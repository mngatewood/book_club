  {title: "Your best friend until you find out he’s a drug dealer", review: "The Great Gatsby is your neighbor you're best friends with until you find out he's a drug dealer. It charms you with some of the most elegant English prose ever published, making it difficult to discuss the novel without the urge to stammer awestruck about its beauty. It would be evidence enough to argue that F. Scott Fitzgerald was superhuman, if it wasn't for the fact that we know he also wrote This Side of Paradise.But despite its magic, the rhetoric is just that, and it is a cruel facade. Behind the stunning glitter lies a story with all the discontent and intensity of the early Metallica albums. At its heart, The Great Gatsby throws the very nature of our desires into a harsh, shocking light. There may never be a character who so epitomizes tragically misplaced devotion as Jay Gatsby, and Daisy, his devotee, plays her part with perfect, innocent malevolence. Gatsby's competition, Tom Buchanan, stands aside watching, taunting and provoking with piercing vocal jabs and the constant boast of his enviable physique. The three jostle for position in an epic love triangle that lays waste to countless innocent victims, as well as both Eggs of Long Island. Every jab, hook, and uppercut is relayed by the instantly likable narrator Nick Carraway, seemingly the only voice of reason amongst all the chaos. But when those boats are finally borne back ceaselessly by the current, no one is left afloat. It is an ethical massacre, and Fitzgerald spares no lives; there is perhaps not a single character of any significance worthy even of a Sportsmanship Award from the Boys and Girls Club.In a word, The Great Gatsby is about deception; Fitzgerald tints our glasses rosy with gorgeous prose and a narrator you want so much to trust, but leaves the lenses just translucent enough for us to see that Gatsby is getting the same treatment. And if Gatsby represents the truth of the American Dream, it means trouble for us all. Consider it the most pleasant insult you'll ever receive.", rating: 5, book_id: 20, user_id: 2 },
  {title: "Great story", review: "It is a great story. It tells a story about a mysterious dog pestering the citizens in Dartmoor. Sherlock Holmes and his partner Wattson try to solve yet another mystery and it isn't easy. I really liked reading this book because it was on an easy level, sometimes I didn't understood every word but when I looked at the context I knew the meaning of the word.It was a intense story, sometimes I had to close the book and take a deep breath before reading what happened next. What I also really liked about this book was that for a Sherlock Holmes story it was easy to read. It made me confident about myself and gave me a good feeling that I understood everything they wrote down. I really recommend this book for people who are trying to learn to read English. The variety in characters makes the boring parts of the story more interesting. I think this is a book anyone who is learning English should read. Not only because it's a good book to start with, but also because it's a classic story everyone should know. I hope this review made you decided to read the book.", rating: 3, book_id: 21, user_id: 3 },

  {title: "Needs an editor.", review: "David Goodis needs an editor. There was probably never a time when he didn’t need one, but in Black Friday (1954 – he published three novels that year) he needs one more than ever. 120 pages of plot-points and motivations hashed over and over till they’re burned in your consciousness – a short novella stretched to three times its optimum length. (If, like Hammett’s  Nightmare Town – its opposite in terms of polish – it was 40 pages it might have cooked.) And the dialogue! UGH! Sure, there’s gold in there, suspended in sewerage. Yet I kept reading for lines like this:In the middle of an endless plain of soft snow there was a pool of black water. A man’s head emerged from the pool and the man opened his mouth and began to shriek.As to the rest, it gets under your skin, follows a logic of its own. I’ve said it before but, in a way, Goodis is the American Kafka, with a third the discipline. There are things he says and shows and infers that burrow down deep in your spirit. In between, you cringe, grit your teeth, soldier on. Since I first read Down There (AKA Shoot the Piano Player) five or six years ago I’ve wondered if that first positive impression was accurate. From the start, I had him pegged as wild, only just in control. But in every book since (except maybe The Burglar, 1953) he seems to lose control. I always forgive him (except in Nightfall, 1947, referred to – inexplicably – by one Geoffrey O’Brien in the intro to Black Friday as “in retrospect an almost perfect book”) but I think my patience is wearing thin. The thing is, in precis (in retrospect?) all his books are masterpieces. Cooked down to their essence, hell, maybe they’re all 'almost perfect'. But just try reading one – it’s like having teeth pulled.", rating: 3, book_id: 2, user_id: 5 },
  {title: "A hefty volume", review: "This is a hefty and imposing volume, heavy yet also compact in dimensions and in print. Thirty-one stories make up the Collected Stories of W. Somerset Maugham, as selected for this immaculate Everyman’s Library edition that I scored for free from my school library. After a particularly work-heavy weekend I needed something I could sink into, something that could envelop me with lush descriptions of far-off lands and times gone by. This short story anthology seemed like it would do the trick: I knew that Maugham had been a prolific writer of short stories, and I was eager to see what the author of the fantastic  Of Human Bondage could do in this medium.Maugham tends to write close to home, and as such, often retreads familiar ground. In reading these stories in quick succession like I did, this becomes all the more apparent. Even the glowing, fanboyish introduction from Nicholas Shakespeare warns that the stories in this book often feel formulaic or repetitive. Of the 31 stories here, I’d say that over half of them are set in the British Malay peninsula (or similar southeast Asian islands under British administration), usually dealing with a governor or similar such administrator, either as the main character or as the subject of a story related by a travelling writer who acts as the narrator. Maugham’s characters invariably seem to play a great deal of bridge and walk around wearing sarongs, and all the native women wear Mother Hubbards. The remainder of the stories usually involve young writer characters observing English high society at arm’s length. The last few stories come from Maugham’s Ashenden collection about a suave, literary spy in Europe during the Great War.Maugham’s stories tend to be what I might call character studies. They focus on a central character and an episode in their life that is particularly important or even fantastic. The stories often end abruptly, just after a flourishing twist that changes the reader’s understanding of the situation. I suspect that, had he wanted to, Maugham might have made a good living as a writer of detective fiction (though he lampoons this genre a couple of times with sly and skilful pseudo-mysteries); it’s a shame he had to suffer in the squalor of fame and fortune like he did.With these character studies, Maugham seems interested in a few different themes. He devotes a lot of time to understanding obsession and what it is about the human spirit that makes us unable to part with things—whether they are possessions, positions, or people. Maugham’s protagonists often have an ambition or obsession that drives them, typically towards a tragic or otherwise surprising end. I wouldn’t call Maugham pessimistic, but he injects a level of cynicism into his stories that seems to imply a less-than-charitable attitude when it comes to human nature. But this is probably what makes Maugham such a great writer, and a particularly accomplished writer of short stories: he is very good at illustrating the flaws of his characters, and flaws make for the best internal, emotional conflicts, as well as the conflicts between the protagonist and others.The stories set in the Pacific islands catered to my interest in colonial and postcolonial fiction. Maugham toured this area during the Great War and the 1920s, in the sunset years of the British Empire when its hold on its colonies was becoming more and more of a formality. The stories depict a kind of tired administrative regime. Life on the islands is full of simple pleasures: bridge games at the club, beachside reading, native mistresses, that sort of thing. Maugham’s administrators often entertain ambitions that echo the old desire to build empires—they like to build roads, in particular, as a harbinger of progress and Western capitalism.Some of his stories deal with the relationship between the colonists and the indigenous peoples; his protagonists are often well-meaning paternalists who “treat the natives like children” and feel affection for what they regard as simpler people. His portrayals of native characters and women are often racist and sexist, but more in a way that reflects the institutional racism and sexism of the era rather than any particular personal bigotry on Maugham’s part. Though I don’t detect anything in his stories that might be directly attributable to his homosexuality, Maugham’s depiction of sexuality in general is very frank and realistic, quite at home with the attitudes towards sexual freedom and celebration that Fitzgerald chronicles in 1920s America. Several of his stories involve marital conflicts brought about or exacerbated by affairs, and in these conflicts, Maugham ascribes sexual agency to both the men and the women involved.As with any large collection, not all of these stories are created equal. And, with a few exceptions, they are all quite long for a short story: I would struggle to read one in a single sitting, which I typically consider a good measure of a short story’s length. Not that this detracts from the quality of the stories, mind you, for Maugham uses this length to good ends. But after twenty or so of them, especially given their repetitive nature, I admit that the lustre was starting to fade.Now that I’ve completed the collection, however, I have to admit that I enjoyed it. Of Human Bondage was my only other experience with Maugham until now, and it floored me. I didn’t have the same reaction to his short stories, but they have reawakened my desire to read more of Maugham’s work—until now, he was mostly a one-book author for me. Now that I have a better sense of his writing and his subject matter, I’m intrigued and want to sample more of his works.This is essential reading, in whatever edition or form one finds it, for fans of Maugham. Newcomers will also find it a fine introduction, albeit one that requires patience and tolerance for repetition. It is, without a doubt, an excellent representation of Maugham’s ability as a writer of short fiction, one who uses the medium to describe and portray the shortcomings and short fuses of individuals thwarted in their desires.", rating: 4, book_id: 5, user_id: 5 },
  {title: "Must read", review: "The idea that there exists such thing as a “must read” book is one of the great fallacies diluting literature. To judge a reader unfavourably because a certain book is not on his or her shelf, rather than to praise and learn from the idiosyncratic choices to be found there instead, is to wish for a literature of bland homogeneity. To label a book “must read” is to condemn it to being misunderstood. And when that book is by the strange, reclusive, haunted black-humourist Franz Kafka, and is given to students to pour over with grave seriousness for hints of political allegory or prophecy, the misunderstanding is so pronounced as to be, in itself, “Kafkaesque”. All those young heads bowed over Metamorphosis, trying their damnedest to see in this giant bug the wisdom of the sage, when the sage himself must surely have been shaking his own head in disbelief at the balls-out irreverence of it, maybe even wondering, “Is it too ridiculous?” It’s as if some high official had ordained that a sacred text be read and reported on by all those seeking admission to the Castle, but when the applicants receive that text they find in it the trivial rantings of a madman. So, desperately, unwilling to crack a smile lest the Castle feel itself mocked, they eke out some tenuous thread of analysis and miss the sacredness, AKA the humour.In speaking of Kafka, Milan Kundera quotes Czech poet Jan Skacel: Poets don’t invent poems The poem is somewhere behind It’s been there for a long time The poet merely discovers itHe goes on to say:Indeed, if instead of seeking “the poem” hidden “somewhere behind” the poet “engages” himself to the service of a truth known from the outset... he has renounced the mission of poetry. And it matters little whether the preconceived truth is called revolution or dissidence, Christian faith or atheism, whether it is more justified or less justified; a poet who serves any truth other than the truth to be discovered (which is dazzlement) is a false poet. At his best, Franz Kafka served this “truth to be discovered”, this “dazzlement”, as devoutly as any writer I know of. This is his legacy: freedom. Or what Kundera calls “radical autonomy”. When occasionally, to the delight of the scholars, he bogs himself down in allegory (“In the Penal Colony”, “Investigations of a Dog”, to some extent “A Hunger Artist”), he fritters away his gift on grand ideals. But when in a moment of sheer wilful abandon his imagination takes over and propels him – like the country doctor unable to control his horses – into the unknown, he is unassailable. “A Country Doctor” is five of the most kaleidoscopic and dizzying pages in history: the horses’ faces lolling like cardboard cutouts in the bedroom window at the end are Kafka’s own rebellious muses laughing at him as he curls up in bed with his wound. His Hunter Gracchus is a journeyer from beyond, washed up by mistake in the quotidian world. “The Knock at the Manor Gate”, “The Test”, “The Helmsman” – everywhere there are things in flux on either side of the boundary of dreams. Unfinished stories abound, because Kafka does not do “finished”. Even the near-perfect Metamorphosis ends with a non-ending, and frequently his neatest stories are his most facile. Kafka’s gift is an inspired one, and inspiration, as we know, doesn’t necessarily wait around while we add the finishing touches. These fragments are seeds, or bombs, and their author a wily rebel possessed by the Imp of the Perverse, unsure himself whether he is a gardener or a terrorist. Just, whatever you do, don’t “study” them. Live these stories or leave them alone. More dead readings will only clutter our view of them.Fact: Kafka is funny.Fact: He’s not for everyone.Fact: He writes to the dictates of his heart, not to preach politics or predict the future. And if you don’t get him, no-one but the most pretentious snob is going to judge you for it. There are no “must read” books.“The Vulture”A vulture was hacking at my feet. It had already torn my boots and stockings to shreds, now it was hacking at the feet themselves. Again and again it struck at them, then circled several times restlessly around me, then returned to continue its work. A gentleman passed by, looked on for a while, then asked me why I suffered the vulture. “I’m helpless,” I said. “When it came and began to attack me, I of course tried to drive it away, even to strangle it, but these animals are very strong, it was about to spring at my face, but I preferred to sacrifice my feet. Now they are almost torn to bits.” “Fancy letting yourself be tortured like this,” said the gentleman, “I’ve only got to go home and get my gun. Could you wait another half-hour?” “I’m not sure about that,” said I, and stood for a moment rigid with pain. Then I said, “Do try it in any case, please.” “Very well,” said the gentleman, “I’ll be as quick as I can.” During this conversation the vulture had been calmly listening, letting its eye rove between me and the gentleman. Now I realized that it had understood everything; it took wing, leaning far back to gain impetus, and then, like a javelin thrower, thrust its beak through my mouth, deep into me. Falling back, I was relieved to feel him drowning irretrievably in my blood, which was filling every depth, flooding every shore.", rating: 5, book_id: 18, user_id: 5 },
  {title: "Expansive", review: "White Teeth is an expansive, detailed, and beautifully written attempt to encapsulate the social chaos that blossoms at the bridging of generational, national and sexual mindsets. It reminds me very much of the freeflowing histories written by Marquez and Allende, as well as Salman Rushdie's strange little one-off treatise on cultural alienation, Fury. (Samad, in particular, reminds me quite a bit of Fury's Malik Solanka.)The book does many things well. Smith has a serious ear for dialogue and accent, she knows how to manage the flow and pacing of a story, and she's quite skilled at employing large concepts (genetic manipulation, immigrant psychology, the concept of history itself) both as fact and as metaphor. Her cast of characters is varied and nearly every one of them comes off as a fully flesh and blood human being. However, it's in terms of these personalities that I feel she makes her biggest misstep.Zadie Smith is what I'd call an Ironist. I don't mean this in the Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Jon Stewart sense. I don't mean that she's a comedian. I mean it in the sense that the territory she stands on--that her narrator in White Teeth stands on--is one whose boundaries are staked out in terms of what she is not. My friend Brandon commented below that Smith shows 'blatant contempt for every character except the one who is clearly based on the author.' While I understand where he's coming from, I don't think it's contempt per se. On the contrary, I think Smith has deep feelings for most of her characters--even the more despicable ones like Crispin and Millat. I think that what Brandon interprets as contempt is something far more ambiguous: let's call it detached superiority.The Ironist defines herself through the process of over-defining others. Every character in this novel is over-defined, over-drawn. While this provides us with a great, at times excruciating level of detail, it also paints each of them into a kind of cage wherein all of their actions are predictable. Each of them has a sort of 'final vocabulary' (cf. Rorty) that defines the limits of what they might do or say--the doctrines of Islam and the Watchtower Society, of PETA or clinical science. In the worst cases, their adherence to these vocabularies allows Smith to slip them into easy 'types' (see: Mr. Topps, Crispin, Joshua, Marcus, the various members of FATE). Smith creates her authorial/narrative identity--what's called a metastable personality--by passively proving that she is not limited by such a final vocabulary, and that in escaping their confines she has a broader, more comprehensive view of the social workings of the world. This is, generally speaking, the goal of any omniscient narrator, but the way that Smith goes about writing this one in particular imparts a certain sense of smugness (the parenthetical asides to the reader, the knowing winks, the jokes at the expense of easy targets) that isn't always present.The metastable personality is the natural reaction to uncomfortability with final vocabularies, but it itself is of course just as self-defining as any of them (albeit in the opposite direction). It instinctually yearns for instability, but prefers to admire chaos from afar rather than living in it. The metastable personality knows that in order to maintain coherence it must remain stable, and that the only way to remain stable is to balance itself on the disbelief of all known final vocabularies. Smith writes off worldview after worldview, but is of course unable to articulate her own because her own is simply the absence of adherence to any such worldview.This isn't so much a criticism of Smith's work as it is an explanation of why it is the way it is, and why it can be read as contempt.", rating: 3, book_id: 26, user_id: 5 },

  {title: "Compelling", review: "This is not the most profound of novels, but it may be the most compelling. Many of its sequences--the Diamond Studs, Milady's seduction of Felton, the attempt of The Three to rescue Constance--move with remarkable rapidity. More notable than these, however, is the entire exposition, something many novelists have found to be a thankless chore, if not a stumbling block. It occupies a full sixty pages, 10% of the book, and, although it covers much ground--the introduction of our hero, the two principal villains, and all three Musketeers with their eccentricities and distinct characters, plus the fight with the Cardinal's Guards, the emergence of D'Artagnan as the 'fourth musketeer,' and an examination of the curious relationship between King and Cardinal--it is constructed with such seamless grace, accomplishes its purposes with such a light touch, and moves so swiftly that the result is astonishing.Sir Walter Scott showed us that the personal is political, that our most particular, most intimate decisions are governed by the political milieu in which we are raised and the allegiances that our background requires. Dumas adopts the contrary principle, namely, that the political is personal: a siege may be lifted, a war started, because an English Duke loves a French Queen. It seems at times that all the characters of 'The Three Musketeers'--even the King and the Cardinal, even that most gifted and ruthless of femme fatales, Milady--are satellites circling the binary star of Buckingham and l'Autriche, whose doomed love is the center of this impossible--and delightful--romantic universe.", rating: 5, book_id: 23, user_id: 7 },
  {title: "Review", review: "Looking for someone to play Virgil to your Dante Alighieri as you make your first descent into James Joyce's Ulysses? Take Stuart Gilbert along with you, and probably keep a lifeline open to Don Gifford. But when you're ready for your first re-read of the book, you could do far worse than bringing Hugh Kenner along for the ride. Kenner is ever thoughtful, always original in his provocative 1980 book, Ulysses, in the Unwin Critical Library series ( Claude Rawson, ed.), which remains an important contribution to criticism of that singular novel by Joyce.The complexity of Joyce's texts, their symmetries and intricately interlacing design elements, captivated me from the beginning. Kenner has much to say about this aspect of Joyce's work, and about other aspects as well. We see how A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is indebted to the numerology and chiasmatic structure of Dante's Vita Nuova, for example (although Kenner doesn't mention it by name): the three episodes and diary entries of Chapter V reverse the overture and three episodes of Chapter I. Evolving characterization colors the narration in Portrait, and this pattern spills over into Ulysses, where the tendency expands exponentially.The construction of Ulysses approximates two kinds of novel joined together, as Kenner points out and illustrates repeatedly. Written in the initial style, the first nine episodes ― Telemachus through Scylla and Charybdis ― can be viewed as a more traditional narrative-based novel which is most well known for its use of interior monologue. Next comes the hinge episode, Wandering Rocks, connecting the first nine episodes to the last eight. Wandering Rocks is a chimera of the initial style and the first striking intrusion by the Arranger (think of an independent second narrator or hijacker of the text; the Arranger was identified and named a decade earlier by David Hayman). This second half of the book ― Sirens through Penelope ― is dominated by the takeover of the text by the intrusive and sabotaging Arranger. Ulysses begins with two triads of episodes: the first group of three and the second group of three take place in different spaces at the same time. The last three episodes of the book ― Eumaeus, Ithaca and Penelope, comprising the final part of the novel, the Nostos, form a natural triad of their own.Importantly, Kenner emphasizes broad structural parallelisms that, as if by magnetic force, bind together certain episodes in the different halves of the book: those linking Aeolus to Cyclops, Proteus to Nausicaa, and Scylla and Charybdis to Oxen of the Sun. These parallelisms and linkages help establish the broadest pattern trussing together the novel's stylistically divergent episodes into a single text. A few examples are demonstrative. The constantly interrupted text of Aeolus is mirrored by the gigantism interruptions, journalistic in style, which break up the text of Cyclops. The Cyclops adventure immediately follows the Aeolus adventure in The Odyssey, so the parallelism is a connection for episodes chronologically separated in Ulysses. Proteus is a two-part episode, with Stephen Dedalus first walking across the sand, then with Stephen sitting on the rocks at Sandymount Strand. Nausicaa is clearly a two-part episode, the first featuring Gerty MacDowell sitting on the sand, the second featuring Leopold Bloom on the rocks at Sandymount Strand. Both Scylla and Charybdis and Oxen of the Sun begin with Stephen as the center of attention among a group of companions until Buck Mulligan arrives to steal the spotlight from him. In The Odyssey the Oxen of the Sun incident follows immediately after the Scylla and Charybdis incident, again restoring a chronological disjunction in Ulysses.Kenner doesn't address the fact that this approach leaves a few episodes unaccounted for; viz., Lestrygonians, Sirens and Circe. Sirens is the opening of the Arranger's grand performance while Circe is its crowning achievement, not to mention a reconstitution of the entire novel up to that point. The Lestrygonians episode, according to this schema, seems to be an orphan.In point of fact, while these are items of interest to Kenner, they are not of overwhelming interest to him, but are illustrative of the content of Kenner's book. Kenner makes many shrewd observations about Ulysses throughout his book that I hadn't noticed previously. He tells us a great deal about Joyce's use of motifs and even of individual words and clusters of words to hold his books together. He demonstrates Buck Mulligan's full frontal nudity in the opening page of the book. He explains that Stephen may well have gone to Sandymount Strand intending to seek lodging for the night. He points out the implications of Corny Kelleher's role as a police informant. He underscores how the orderliness of the first half of the book begins to give way to the chaos of the second half in close approximation to the time of the assignation between Molly and Boylan. He notes how the tableau of Mina Purefoy in labor at the lying-in hospital, even as the doctors carouse downstairs, picks up on the imagery of Penelope and the Suitors in The Odyssey. On the first page of Scylla and Charybdis, Kenner mentions, Eglinton mentions six brave medicals, and in Oxen of the Sun Stephen confronts six not-exactly-brave medicals. Stephen imagines William Shakespeare as a restless man with a lively daughter and a dead son, uneasily yoked to a wife who conquered him once and cuckolds him now, all of which equally apply to Leopold Bloom. The sailor Murphy has tattooed on his chest a portrait of the artist as a young man. On and on.Kenner concludes his book by referring to Ulysses as ― I paraphrase ― a hologram of words. This may be the best description of Ulysses as I've ever encountered, for reasons too complicated to spell out here. This is an excellent book about Ulysses and one that is very well written. Much to think about. Quite recommended.", rating: 5, book_id: 24, user_id: 8 },
  {title: "Review", review: "This is a traditional cautionary tale about two children beset by tragedy early on, only to be given good fortune as they grow older and closer. However the two set out on different paths as they become adults. One is impatient to have all that he wants and falls victim to the negative influences of a friend who steers him toward ruin. Veronica, the other, is virtuous and hard-working, yet sorrow is never far from her thoughts. So they both have their lessons to learn, and as is the case with most books written in this time, they eventually find their way and come together again.After reading the author's far superior and better known work, Heidi, I was disappointed in this short novel. Whereas Heidi felt very contemporary and timeless, this story is heavily dated in its Christian moralism. The characters were very flat, which surprised me given the depth of many of the characters in Heidi. All in all, it was okay, mainly because it was so slim. If it had lingered any longer, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it.", rating: 3, book_id: 25, user_id: 9 },
  {title: "About the author", review: "Langston Hughes was one of America's master writers of the twentieth century. For over forty years, he used his time to write, lecture, and promote better conditions for African Americans through his work. Most known for his poetry, Hughes also wrote a variety of works including song lyrics, a play, and an autobiography. Hughes chose the poems in Selected Poems shortly before his death in 1967 and included most of his well known work. Selected Poems is collection befitting of an American master. I remember reading 'Mother to Son' when I was in school. We had to analyze it and then use the style to write our own poetry. The last line still stands out for me, 'life ain't been no crystal stair.' Hughes discusses how the African American experience has been full of hardships. In this particular poem he has a mother convey to her son to work extra hard so he has the opportunity to make something more of his life. In the same section, a family throws a celebration for Mary Lou Jackson because she received a diploma and can now get a job. Even if it is low level job, at least she will be earning money and assisting her family. Unfortunately, life was rarely a crystal stair for African Americans when Hughes wrote the majority of his poetry. A line that is still recognized today is 'if you're white, you're all right...if you're black, Get back!' This was written when the Migration north and west was beginning. Hughes writes of the poor conditions of the south and how African Americans rode a freedom train out of this sometimes horrid existence. He goes on to describe the contrast of the bright lights in Harlem and Chicago to the fear of being lynched and killed just for being black in the South. Even though the Migration was just picking up steam at the time when he wrote, Hughes recognized the opportunity for freedom for his people and encouraged them to move in his writing. The plight of African Americans can best be summed up in Hughes' ending two sections. His montage of a dream deferred explains how a man can to keep dropping out of school to help his family and then was held back a grade when they moved north. Finally at age twenty he is ready to graduate and he feels too old to first be starting out in life. Hughes ends the collection with powerful words by quoting Jefferson, Lincoln, and Frederick Douglass. 'Better to die free, than to live slaves,' he motivates his people, and 'Keep your hand on the plow! Hold on!' The American dream is for all people as long as they keep a positive outlook on life and make the best of the opportunities granted them. I am participating in an African American history month challenge this year, and I have both fiction and nonfiction books lined up to read. I am glad that I started the month with poetry written by a true American master. Hughes voice speaks of the raw emotions of what African Americans experienced and he used his voice as a platform to better their conditions. A powerful collection, I rate Langston Hughes' Selected Poems a full 5 bright stars.", rating: 5, book_id: 15, user_id: 10 },

It's true, Malcolm is mentioned as dead at the end of Jurassic Park. To be exact, Muldoon is telling Grant what's happened to everyone else as they're flying away in the helicopter: 'What about Malcolm?' Grant said. Muldoon shook his head.The epilogue mentions the Costa Rican government not permitting the burial of John Hammond or Ian Malcolm (amongst a list of other ways they dragged their feet and covered things up). But that's it.My point is this: it's not as if Crichton tricked us by delivering a long death scene where Ian Malcolm said his last goodbyes and made some final point about evolution and chaos theory - then got lazy and just reintroduced Malcolm into the next book. Malcolm's 'death' in JP was not seen, and only vaguely mentioned (unlike every other major character who died in the book). Also, the explanation given in The Lost World as to why the others thought he was dead was completely plausible - he was simply so close to death that he was left for dead.I'll get off of my soapbox now. For me, The Lost World was a satisfying and exciting read. I think I read it in about a day and a half the first time, and I've re-read it a few times since.", rating: 5, book_id: 21, user_id: 14 },
  {title: "Crazy", review: "Today, Hans Christian Andersen would be given drugs and therapy, and then more drugs. He would be put into a study about repressed homosexuals and boys with a mamma fixation. All this because of his stories. Andersen’s stories are also not very happy when you truly think about them. For every happy story, like “The Ugly Duckling”, there are at least two sad stories. Yet Andersen, at least in American circles, is considered a children’s author. Whether this is due to those editions or retellings of Andersen’s stories that make the ending happy, I don’t know. I do know that I have read Andersen more times than I have read the Brothers Grimm and that Andersen speaks to more people than the Grimm brothers ever will. The Grimms were interested in collecting folktales and folklore. Andersen is interested in telling stories. Outside of Demark and other northern countries, he is known for his stories, in particular for his fairy stories. This is misleading for Andersen also wrote plays and poems as well as travelogues and autobiographies. His first success wasn’t with his fairy stories. His poem about a mother mourning her dead children is touching (and a theme that enters into one of his tales). Even just considering his stories, people are misled. Everyone thinks they know “The Little Mermaid,” “The Ugly Duckling”, or “The Little Match Girl”, fewer people know the stories how they actually are and even fewer know more of Andersen’s work, such as “The Shadow” or ‘”The Storks”. This does Andersen a huge injustice. Andersen was heavily influenced by several things in his writing. It is common knowledge that he was influenced by folklore and the stories told to him by his grandmother, but he was also influenced by the German writers that predated him or who were his contemporaries. While it is not apparent in his better known tales, he had a strong love of country (even though he always seemed to be traveling away from it) as well as a good dose of patriotism. He was also religious, though this seems to come though in his tale more than anything else. Several critics have pointed out that Andersen has a cult of suffering. His leads his heroes and heroines always suffer. The Ugly Duckling gets frozen in water, the Little Mermaid feels as if she is walking on knives (or broken glass); the Marsh King’s Daughter is transformed into a frog, the little Match Girl freezes to death, the money pig breaks, the storks deliver dead babies. Andersen’s characters seem to suffer far more than those people in the Grimm’s tales (though that isn’t a cake walk either). Andersen, however, is still a considered a children’s author because of the tone, his use of sound (read his tales aloud if you don’t believe me), of putting himself in a child’s shoes (who doesn’t imagine the flowers coming to life).  Too often people look at Andersen in the simplest terms. Take “The Little Mermaid” for example. Many today know the story not as Andersen’s but as Disney’s. They think that the mermaid marries her prince and everyone lives happily ever after. While the cursory reader of Andersen knows that this is not the ending, a deeper reading reveals, if not a happy ending, perhaps a slightly hopeful one as well as a few details about the prince. In the mermaid’s story, Andersen presents a people where the women seem to help each (the witch, the mermaid’s sisters, the mermaid herself) and where the only male who does anything is the prince himself. The mermaid and her sisters are desexualized (she loses her voice, they their hair). The prince treats the mermaid like his pet dog. The mermaid, however, wants a soul more than a prince. She acts more as if she has a soul more than prince. By taking “The Little Mermaid” and reducing the plot to a love story, the adaptor or reader does Andersen a disservice and dismisses the larger issue. In the story, it is the non-humans, the merfolk, who appear to have those virtues that humanity claims – compassion. The mermaid might eventually get her soul though she doesn’t get her prince. Today, there is a movement to de-religion stores (look at Narnia in both the movies and the exhibit), but to do so to Andersen guts this story. Or take “The Marsh King’s Daughter”, one of Andersen’s lesser known popular tales. Fairy Tales always treat rape as a non issue or blame the victim. Sleeping Beauty, for example, in some versions is woken by the birth of twins, yet never seems to feel any emotional upheaval. Andersen is one of the few fairy tale writers to deal with the issue of rape and not fully gloss over it. Like the Grimms, who buried the incest theme of some tales, Andersen glosses over the attack that starts “The Marsh King’s Daughter”. The daughter of the title is the offspring of the Marsh King and the Egyptian princess who he attacks. This daughter is full of rage and pain except at night when she becomes a frog. Part of the story is about the daughter coming to terms with this rage. Where else would the rage come off except for the attack on the mother? Many of Andersen’s tales are concerned with relationships, in particular those of mothers and children. Many critics have discovered or argued for the presence of Andersen’s own relationship with his mother in these tales. Andersen’s mother, who gave birth to a bastard daughter before marrying Andersen’s father, comes off looking less like a saint and more like a drunk if this is true. But then, there is a tale like “She Was a Good for Nothing” where the mother is a drunk who dearly loves and cares for her son. In this story, Andersen contrasts public view versus private life, of how the upper class views the lower class. Andersen is often concerned with class in his tales. The upper classes tend to be dismissive of the lower classes, though it is the lower classes that exhibit more of those human virtues. Sometimes, like in “The Tinderbox”, Andersen even seems to attack the royalty, seemingly suggesting that the old order must give to the new. Even in his class stories, Andersen also shows a great love and knowledge of his country. Some of his stories are about the humble beginnings of Great Danes (no, not the dogs) like Thorvaldsen, whose work Andersen seemed to love if Andersen’s stories are anything to go by. It should also be noted that in some of stories, especially in stories where different classes of children met, Andersen suggests more of equality than out and out class warfare. Andersen’s stories aren’t all for children; in fact, as he wrote more stories, Andersen saw himself as writing more for adults and this would example the class conscious stories, but also the longer stories like “The Ice Maiden” or “Ib and Little Christine”. It is in the longer stories that one can see the German romantic influence on Andersen. While the tales are more adult, they also consider several of the same themes that inhabit his more child friendly stories. While “Ib and Little Christine” can be rather annoying if you are female reader, it is impossible to describe the creeping feeling of unease that stories such as “The Ice Maiden” and “The Shadow” inspire. Andersen borrowed from more than his grandmother and the Germans. His “The Rose Elf” presents a revenge minded “Pot of Basil”, a twist on a familiar tale presented by Boccaccio but also used by Keats among others. Andersen’s variation of the “Seven Swans” makes far more sense than other versions, even if it is chaster than those other versions. Andersen’s most famous story might be “The Ugly Duckling”, a story that many critics, rightly it seems, consider to be Andersen’s most autobiographical work. This isn’t to say that the similar theme of belonging, of fitting in, doesn’t appear in other works. There are shades of “Duckling” in “Thumbelina” as well as some of the class conscious Andersen short stories. “The Ugly Duckling” is more memorable because the plot of the story could happen. The plot of “Thumbelina”, not so much. We believe in the duckling becoming the swan because of the way Andersen sets up the story – a mistake could happen. Today, even with all our supposed advancements, you still have hospital mix ups. In most of Andersen’s stories, the reader can meet actual places and people that Andersen knew or admired. Edvard Collin, Andersen’s man crush, appears, as does Jenny Lind. Even smaller characters in Andersen’s history, less well known to the average reader, seem to appear. Andersen’s teachers, the women Andersen felt rejected him (or whom Andersen allowed himself to be rejected by); all seem to appear. Copenhagen is a time honored companion in the stories, but so is Andersen’s love of Italy. This sense of place gives another level of reality to the tales, a level that seems to be missing from the works of the Grimms or Perrault. While many of Andersen’s tales have “morals” or lessons, they are not spelled out as in the work of Aesop or Fontatine. Andersen respects his reader, be that reader a child or an adult, and knows that his reader can follow his lesson without the moral being directly spelled out. Perhaps it is this reason that examines Andersen’s staying power even among, or especially among, female readers.Andersen’s female characters do seem to get punished at far steeper rate than his male characters. While it is true that the Ugly Duckling freezes, his end is far different than those ends of the girls in “The Little Match Girl”, “The Red Shoes” or “The Girl Who Trod on a Loaf”. To say that Andersen was sexist would be a mistake. Even in stories where the girl is horribly punished there are good women – the grandmother, the girl who prays for Karen.", rating: 5, book_id: 18, user_id: 15 },

Friends and relatives, conversations, farms, birds, deer, dogs, war, love, cunts, gods, poets, death, philosophy. Nothing turns me off from a poem more than starting it out by talking about an animal. Animals and long-lines guarantee that I won't be reading it. Still, it's C. K. Williams, and he's a good poet.As I skimmed, I marked off the poems that struck me as the ones I wish I'd written. Not surprisingly, they're the shorter-lined, several-stanza verses. 'The Other Side,' 'Ashes Ashes We All Fall Down,' 'Trash,' 'After That,' 'Becoming Somebody Else,' and 'Yours' are all from his earliest collections. I've learned that I like early CKW. I did surprise myself by reading through and actually liking 'The Shade,' which is a long-lined poem that also mentions sparrows. Shocking.I tried to skip around and find other gems--'This Happened' and 'Wood' from his later works popped out with semi-long lines. Poems are not all about line-length. My motivation to read them is. CKW uses language, abuses language, makes language his proverbial bitch; he concocts images that have never existed. He speaks of rooms with no gods, being ravaged and ravished, women becoming wood and steel, and cellophane, which is one of the greatest words in the English language. So for me, I can take CKW in small doses. Reading the entire collected poems was a large undertaking. I much prefer the mini-collection I made by marking off pages and going back to them.

Oprah story inspires the lives of children and adults alike. It was simple to grasp the important key facts of Oprah’s life. This book is a great way for children to learn to take important facts from a text. I would share this book with my class to illustrate the example of influential people that have built their own empire from the ground up. This will teach children that nothing is impossible if you have a vision and plan in place. 3/28/2016", rating: 5, book_id: 13, user_id: 17 },
  {title: "Master storyteller", review: "Rudyard Kipling, who lived in India during the time of the British Raj (1865-1936), was a master storyteller with an undisputed genius for creating the beauty and lure of his exotic world on paper in such an enchanting and yet believable form that we as readers must refer to Shakespeare and Dickens to find writers as precocious.As his career developed, Kipling's talent grew, and he refined his style and continued to become a better writer. Reading these forty stories, which span his entire career, it is obvious that the writings at the end of his life are significantly better than the remarkable work at the beginning. It is also important to note that his work mirrors the emotional milestones in his life. For example, 'Baa Baa, Black Sheep' is a heart-wrenching revisiting of Kipling's childhood trauma. Due to this trauma, revenge is a common theme in his early stories; however, when Kipling himself experiences the loss of his beloved six-year-old daughter Josephine in 1899 and his son John in the war in 1915, he begins to reveal his feelings and deal with them in his fiction. He emerges from themes of revenge to embrace themes of healing. These come at the end of the book and include stories like 'Dayspring Mishandled,' 'The House Surgeon,' and 'Mary Postgate.'There are so many delightful and varied stories: the mystical 'The Gardener,' the superb adventure 'The Man Who Would Be King,' and 'The Wish House,' which deals with old age and death, and may be Kipling's finest story; however, there are so many fine, true stories. How can we choose just one? Reading the collection in its entirety is the only way to get a true sense of Kipling's achievement as the master short story writer.", rating: 5, book_id: 5, user_id: 18 },
  {title: "Obsessed!", review: "This book has ignited a full-blown Carson McCullers obsession in me. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter was a phenomenal book but these stories (short stories and two novellas) actually took my breath away. They also made my heart flutter and my stomach go all swoopy, which confirms that I'm hopelessly crushing on the work of a dead author. Is that even possible?It's amazing how believable these bizarre, sad, lonely characters are--maybe because she poured so much of herself into so many of them. I'm invariably hooked two or three sentences into every story. The Member of the Wedding, one of the included novellas, is actually painful to read because it perfectly captures the haunting loneliness of a girl on the cusp of adolescence in a small town. Very little happens in actual fact in the story, but the emotional journey seems epic. McCullers has an amazing ability to make you really care about her characters and it's almost like she's excited just to share them with you.Revisiting 'The Haunted Boy', which we studied in (I think) ninth grade English, was pretty awesome since it came back to me as I read it. Amazing how in such a short story McCullers can tackle so much painful thematic material and treat it in such a careful, sensitive way. In the hands of another author, this story could easily have been way too depressing to read, but as it stands it's beautifully balanced.The Ballad of the Sad Cafe made me cry and laugh really, really hard. I'd never really gotten that whole 'grotesque' thing until I read this story, but I think I get it now. It's absolutely wonderful.Anyway, great collection.

  {title: "Who knew?", review: "Did you know that James Schuyler went to Italy with Auden as his typist? No? Me neither. He was also 'curator of circulating exhibitions' at MOMA in the late 1950s, and the 1981 Pultizer Prize winner. He wrote Frank O'Hara's elegy, and he died of a stroke in 1991. These are all things I found out after reading this collection - I try not to learn anything about a poet when I am reading them.Schuyler's poems traverse countryside and cityscape, illness and joy, gossip and intimacy. He spends most, if not all, of his time firmly in the real world - few flights of fancy, few big questions. The poems range from the fat and prosey (see 'Milk', below) to the slim and delineated - 'Salute'Past is past, and if oneremembers what one meantto do and never did, isnot to have thought to doenough? Like that gather-ing of one of each Iplanned, to gather oneof each kind of clover,daisy, paintbrush thatgrew in that fieldthe cabin stood in andstudy them one afternoonbefore they wilted. Pastis past. I salutethat various field.While the tone and style is usually intimate and loose - the poems don't seem to have an arc, or a beginning and middle and end; instead they seem simply to start at some point and stop at another, wrapping up elements that could be switched about and rearranged - my favourite of Schuyler's poems so far is one of the most structured and formal (if also one of the most oblique):'Poem'I do not always understand what you say.Once, when you said, across, you meant along.What is, is by its nature, on display.Words' meanings count, aside from what they weigh:poetry, like music, is not just song.I do not always understand what you say.You would hate, when with me, to meet by dayWhat at night you met and did not think wrong.What is, is by its nature, on display.I sense a heaviness in your light play,a wish to stand out, admired, from the throng.I do not always understand what you say.I am as shy as you. Try as we may,only by practice will our talks prolong.What is, is by its nature, on display.We talk together in a common way.Art, like death, is brief: life and friendship long.I do not always understand what you say.What is, is by its nature, on display.(A word-memory tingled in my head when I just now read that last line out loud to myself. It's iambic pentameter, I think (I'm a rank beginner - don't hold it against me if I get this all wrong) and therefore is going to sound like everything else, but the lines that rose up in my mind actually happen to be Auden's: 'O John I'm in heaven,' I whispered to say: / But he frowned like thunder and he went away.)A friend told me recently that I have a 'certain type of poem' - he didn't extend upon the statement, but I'm pretty sure 'Letter Poem #3' is such a piece; lyrical, a little love-lorn, yet anchored to the real world.The night is quietas a kettle drumthe bullfrog bassestuning up. Afterswimming, after sup-per, a Tarzan movie,dishes, a smoke. Oneplanet and Iwish. No needof words. Justyou, or rather,us. The stars tonightin pale dark spaceare clover flowersin a lawn the expandinguniverse in whichwe love it isour home. So manygalaxies and you mybright particular,my star, my sun, myother self, my bet-ter half, my oneMy own writing has a weakness for the running and, and, and, so it's not surprising I fall for Schuyler's romantic list-makings.I have developed a particular fondness for Schuyler's 'month' poems. They are chronicles of the unremarkable, and this in itself is unremarkable: I often feel that with every other piece of art I try to describe I'm trying to find a new way to say that the artist has taken something from the every day world and made it extra-ordinary. But then there are those who try to do this, and those who succeed, and Schuyler for me, in these poems, falls firmly into the second camp.'October'Books litter the bed,leaves the lawn. Itlightly rains. Fall hascome: unpatterned, inthe shedding leaves.The maples ripen. Applescome home crisp in bags.This pear tastes good.It rains lightly on therandom leaf patterns.The nimbus is spreadabove our island. Rainlightly patters on un-shed leaves. The booksof fall litter the bed.'December'The giant Norway spruce from Podunk, its lower branches bound, this morning was reared into place at Rockefeller Center. I thought I saw a cold blue dusty light sough in its boughs the way other years the wind thrashing at the giant ornaments recalled other years and Christmas trees more homey. Each December! I always think I hate “the over-commercialized event” and then bells ring, or tiny light bulbs wink above the entrance to Bonwit Teller or Katherine going on five wants to look at all the empty sample gift-wrapped boxes up Fifth Avenue in swank shops and how can I help falling in love? A calm secret exultation of the spirit that tastes like Sealtest eggnog, made from milk solids, Vanillin, artificial rum flavoring; a milky impulse to kiss and be friends It’s like what George and I were talking about, the East West Coast divide: Californians need to do a thing to enjoy it. A smile in the street may be loads! you don’t have to undress everybody.  “You didn’t visit the Alps?”  “No, but I saw from the train they were black  and streaked with snow.” Having and giving but also catching glimpses hints that are revelations: to have been so happy is a promise and if it isn’t kept that doesn’t matter. It may snow falling softly on lashes of eyes you love and a cold cheek grow warm next to your own in hushed dark familial December. 'February'A chimney, breathing a little smoke.The sun, I can't seemaking a bit of pinkI can't quite see in the blue.The pink of five tulipsat five p.m. on the day before March first.The green of the tulip stems and leaveslike something I can't remember,finding a jack-in-the-pulpita long time ago and far away.Why it was December thenand the sun was on the seaby the temples we'd gone to see.One green wave moved in the violet sealike the UN Building on big evenings,green and wetwhile the sky turns violet.A few almond treeshad a few flowers, like a few snowflakesout of the blue looking pink in the light.A gray hushin which the boxy trucks roll up Second Avenueinto the sky. They're just going over the hill.The green leaves of the tulips on my desklike grass light on flesh,and a green-copper steepleand streaks of cloud beginning to glow.I can't get overhow it all works in togetherlike a woman who just came to her windowand stands there filling itjogging her baby in her arms.She's so far off. Is it the lightthat makes the baby pink?I can see the little fistsand the rocking-horse motion of her breasts.It's getting grayer and gold and chilly.Two dog-size lions face each otherat the corners of a roof.It's the yellow dust inside the tulips.It's the shape of a tulip.It's the water in the drinking glass the tulips are in.It's a day like any other.Those last four lines. How can they not leave you undone? How can you not repeat them over and over to yourself (I get shades of the For want of a nail rhythm when I do this) - gradually growing out from the pollen to the flower to the container to the whole of the world, going about its business as a flower sits on your desk and somehow by looking at it and letting your mind float you connect with that world in a totally unexpected way. And there's what Schuyler does with colour - he eschews analogy, uses small, plain nouns, yet makes so much of them. I want to take 'February' and colour it in, in a way that wouldn't be cheesy and awful, but instead would draw out the way we are subtly shuttled between colour and colour and colour - pink to blue to pink, green, green / violet / green / violet, blue looking pink, a gray hush, green, pink, gray gold yellow: 'I can't get over / how it all works together' indeed.I promised you fat and prosey at the beginning of this wander through my fancies. Here you go: 'Milk'Milk used to come in tall glass, heavy and uncrystalline as frozen melted snow. It rose direct and thick as horse-chestnut tree trunks that do not spread out upon the ground even a little: a shaft of white drink narrowing at the cream and rounded off in a thick-lipped grin. Empty and unrinsed, a diluted milk ghost entrapped and dulled light and vision. Then things got a little worse: squared, high-shouldered and rounded off in the wrong places, a milk replica of a handmade Danish wooden milk bat. But that was only the beginning. Things got worse than that. Milk came in waxed paper that swelled and spilled and oozed flat pieces of milk. It had a little lid that didn’t close properly or resisted when pulled so that when it did give way milk jumped out. Things are getting better now. Milk is bigger—half-a-gallon, at least—in thin milky plastic with a handle, a jug founded on an oblong. Pick it up and the milk moves, rising enthusiastically in the neck as it shifts its center of weight. Heavy as a breast, but lighter, shaping itself without much changing shape: like bringing home the milk in a bandana, a neckerchief or a scarf, strong as canvas water wings whose strength was only felt dragged under water. On the highway this morning at the go-round, about where you leave New Hampshire, there had been an accident. Milk was sloshed on the gray-blue-black so much like a sheet of early winter ice you drove over it slowly, no matter what the temperature of the weather that eddied in through the shatterproof glass gills. There were milk-skins all around, the way dessert plates look after everyone has left the table in the Concord grape season. Only bigger, unpigmented though pretty opaque, not squashed but no less empty. Trembling, milk is coming into its own.You're still here? Good. Because I've saved two of the best for last.

  {title: "Separates man from God", review: "That a poet who rejected modernity because it separated men from God wrote in a contemporary, ground-breaking style that defied classic understanding is not only ironic, but also a prodigy. Eliot’s creative output is a case of study on its own because the words that compose his verses transcend literal sense through structural frame and allocation. It’s not until one feels the irresistible pull to recite Eliot’s poems out loud that the perplexing repetition, the echo of recurrent expressions, placed and misplaced, lost and recovered, in stillness and movement, form a whole unit of sound that possesses an incantatory, almost karmic effect that Seamus Heaney describes as 'soundscape', that Eliot's verses acquire indomitable meaning.Take these stanzas in Ash-Wednesday as examples:“Because I know that time is always timeAnd place is always and only placeAnd what is actual is actual only for one timeAnd only for one place”Or“If the lost word is lost, if the spent word is spentIf the unheard, unspokenWord is unspoken, unheard;Still is the unspoken word, the Word unheard.The Word without a word, the Word within” The wordplay goes deeper than presenting an ambiguous, fragmentary aspect that obscures its possible interpretation, it speaks of an extraordinary feverish state that moves from spiritual barrenness towards resignation, passing through loss and angst that converge in the last section of the poem with a flicker of hope achieved through exhaustion.The protagonists of the early poems, Mr. Alfred Prufrock, with his unfulfilled yearning and carnal desire, and Mr. Sweeney, the opposite of the former with his directness in addressing basic and more lascivious appetites; get easily entangled with the voice of the poet creating a dramatic pulse that blends with the confessional tone of an inner monologue delivered in rhyme. Still, the numerous literary references to Dante, Shakespeare, the French symbolists and of course, the Bible, enable endless connotations to the poems; satire, parody, paean or ode; all coexist in the polysemic verses that are united by the common musicality of Eliot’s delivery.Even though I admired the architectural device of the philosophical meditation on death and self-denial confronted through the prism of Eastern vs. Western aestheticism that permeates “The Waste Land” or the hypnotic moralizing of the Choruses from “The Rock”, my heart leapt, my soul soared with “Marina” and the most comforting bleakness tinted my spirit with black emptiness of “The Hollow Men”. The first is an allegoric tribute to The Bard and his tendency to present truth as craziness, using the most vivid imagery related to the sea; and the second is a fugue to the inherent isolation that consumes man’s soul when confronted with its artificial, superficial needs. In the end, like the yews that offer ominous shade to Eliot’s poetic landscape, words represent the secret depths of the human ethos, but they will always elude stationary definitions. Their worth is merely symbolical, ethereal, straddling reality and appearance, eternal life and mortality. Them words linger and become more solid when they reverberate in the dark cavities of our consciousness. “I made this, I have forgottenAnd remember.The rigging weak and the canvas rottenBetween one June and another September.Made this unknowing, half conscious, unknown, my own.” Included in this selection:• Prufrock and other observations• Poems 1920, a selection.• The Waste Land• The Hollow Men• Ash-Wednesday• Choruses from 'The Rock'", rating: 5, book_id: 15, user_id: 21 },
  {title: "Review", review: "My Grandpa Cannon loved this story, and he often told of a time when he went to see a 'picture show' about the Hound of the Baskervilles. 'It scared the willies out of me,' he said, and then he and his friend had to part ways as my grandpa rode his bicycle home in the dark.He was thinking about this devil-hound, and then he heard something panting behind him. He pedaled faster and faster, but the panting only got faster and faster too. Then, it was harder and harder to pedal, and his bike was going slower and slower. Just when he thought for sure he was doomed to die and the hound would get him, his bike stopped, the panting stopped, and he found that his back wheel had a flat tire. A flap of rubber had made the panting sound as the air was being released.That has nothing to do with this story, except that it is the reason I read the book. Good book too!

  {title: "Difficult to understand", review: "Shakespeare’s plays can be difficult to understand. The language is not modern, the plots can get lost amidst the various characters and their dialogue, and that is before one consider any of the imagery used or the various readings of it possible (leaving aside the question of which readings are more legitimate than others, or whether particular plays should be read for anything more than what they are). Books such as these are a very useful tool in understanding classic texts.This book concisely, lucidly and helpfully explains The Tempest. Not only does it go through the plot so that one can understand what is happening, it briefly places the play in Shakespeare’s life context, explains some unusual words and gives some brief commentaries about it. Designed for students and probably aimed at high school students, it is both them and those merely wanting to understand what this play is all about (such as I) that can benefit from this book.", rating: 3, book_id: 22, user_id: 24 },
  {title: "Hunch", review: "I would love to say that I chose this book because I saw it in some library and thanks to my keen eye and awesome brain, I decided to read it because I had this weird hunch that it was going to be amazing. Unfortunately, the reason why I chose it is far less poetic. I think a lot of us got to know this poet because of that movie. From the first time I watched it, I couldn't get a particular poem out of my head. It was recited by a man at his partner's funeral. Such a beautiful and intense poem. Those verses were filled with love and sorrow, vivid images and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. I loved it. I knew I had to read more about the guy that was able to write such thing. Years and years passed by, and here I am. I found this collection and it was a delightful read. Auden has a very personal style. He wrote about many issues such as love, loss, politics, religion. I'm no expert so I won't analyze forms and structures, but I did love the content. A lovely, evocative, wonderful content. I love when writers can take any ordinary situation and describe it like it's the most miraculous thing in the world and with every beautiful word that their language has to offer.If I have to choose between heartbreaking, bittersweet, intense poetry and this... hmm. What to do? What to do... Tough call. (Yes, I'm still mad about that one.)There are many poems that I loved: 'Will you turn a deaf ear'; 'The unknown citizen'; 'In memory of Sigmund Freud'; 'Law, say the gardeners, is the sun'; 'The more loving one', 'O what is that sound which so thrills the ear', 'As I walked out one evening': '…But all the clocks in the cityBegan to whirr and chime:'O let not Time deceive you,You cannot conquer Time...'True.Anyway, I should end this review (I really need to find another word to describe these 'things') with the most important part of the anecdote I previously shared. The poem I was referring to is 'Funeral Blues' (you knew!). Its origins I refuse to believe. It's a beautiful thing to read and that's it.Enjoy. Or weep. Or both.“Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,Silence the pianos and with muffled drumBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.Let aeroplanes circle moaning overheadScribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,Put crêpe bows round the white necks of the public    doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.He was my North, my South, my East and West,My working week and my Sunday rest,My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.For nothing now can ever come to any good.

  {title: "Difficult to read", review: "I always find it difficult to review a book, for so many thoughts keep jumping around at a time in my mind but the suitable words to express those thoughts always seem to deceiving me, and even more so difficult to review poetry, for (I feel) poetry itself is creation of refined art, it is a like something suspended in a thin air and which could be interpreted in so many ways, like a free flowing water stream which takes the color of landscapes it traverses through; nevertheless I try to write something about this amazing collection of poems by Borges and I hope it would be of some use to fellow readers. Selected Poems brings together some two hundred poems - the largest collection of Borges poetry ever assembled in English, including many never previously translated. The brilliance of the Spanish originals is matched with luminous English versions. Borges sees himself first as a poet and only then as the writer of the stories that have made him famous, till the time his poems have been all but unavailable in English. Fervor de Buenos Aires represents a youthful Borges more directly concerned with the specific, local and vernacular, he develops his mature themes--time, imagination, and identity--throughout. Taken together, the poems distill those concerns, which famously preoccupy him in the brief ficciones. And, like the fictions, they are almost disturbingly comprehensible. One peak of the collection is  The Maker/ El hacedor , showing Borges at his most defined and refined, presenting sophisticated riffs on Arisosto, Luke and 'The Other Tiger' with elegance and gusto. Excerpts:Little by little, the beautiful universe left him behind: a stubborn mist blurred the outline of his hand, the night was emptied of stars, and the ground grew beneath his feet. Everything receded and ran together. When he realized he was going blind, he cried out; Stoic modesty had yet to be invented, and hector could flee unperturbed. Borges explored so many different themes in these poems however a few of the themes which are prominent throughout the collection are time, memory, blindness, age, God, mirrors; the poem ‘The Hourglass’ specifically explored the theme of time in both temporal and metaphorical manner- the idea that time and fate are alike is stark proof of it. Here Borges used ‘hourglass’ as symbol of cosmic time wherein the falling and rising of sand in it represents the ageing of universe/ humankind. It’s one of the most beautiful and lyrical poems of the collection.Excerpts:Pleasure there is in watching how the sand Slowly slithers up and males a slopeThen, just about to fall, piles up againWith an insistence that appears quite human,The sand of every cycle is the sameAnd infinite is the history of sand;So, underlying your fortunes and your sorrows,Yawns an invulnerable eternity.It never stops, the spilling of the sand.I am the one who weakens, not the glass. The rite of falling sand is infiniteAnd, with the sand, our lives are leaving us. The Argentine poet had been fascinated with idea of death and God, he has explored the theme of God in the poem ‘Chess’ wherein the idea that we all are acting on the moves by the creator or God if a chess board considered as a symbol for life, the logic of life can’t be defined as it moves by some magic- what magic really is? Something which can’t be defined by our understanding of life or something which deceives us. The existential traits about nausea towards inability to control one’s own life could be traced out in it, the angst and absurdness that one doesn’t know that one’s life is controlled by someone else- someone omnipotent- is clearly visible in the poem.Excerpts:Within the game itself the forms gives offTheir magic rules: Homeric castle, knightSwift to attack, queen warlike, king decisive,Slanted bishop, and attacking pawns.………………………………….They do not know it is player’s handThat dominates and guide their destiny.They do not know an adamantine fateControls their will and lays the battle plan.……………….God moves the player, he in turn the piece.But what god beyond God begins the roundOf dust and time and sleep and agonies? The fascination with Mirrors can be seen in these poems also as in case of his prose- one of the poems titled ‘Mirrors’ accentuated it, the documentary The Mirror Man captures Borges’ s childhood fascination with mirrors and mirror-like surfaces. “More than anything the boy feared another self reflected in the polished furniture and dark mirrors of the house.”Excerpts:I have been horrified before all mirrorsnot just before the impenetrable glass,the end and the beginning of that spaceinhabited by nothing reflections,but faced with specular water, mirroringthe other blue within its bottomless sky,incised at time by the illusory flightof inverted birds, or troubled by a ripple,or face to face with the unspeaking surfaceof ghostly ebony whose very hardnessreflects, as if within a dream, the whitenessof spectral marble or a spectral rose. The poems of ‘In Praise of Darkness’ confront encroaching blindness, old age and the possibility of ethics, reaching beyond the expectations created by Borges's mastery of the fantastic and the metaphysical. The result is poems at times as moving as Stevens's 'The Rock.'Excerpts from  In Praise of Darkness- June, 1968:The man is blind, and knows He won’t be able to decodeThe handsome volumes he is handling,And that they will never help writeThe book that will justify his life in others’ eyes;But in the afternoon that might be goldHe smiles at his curious fateAnd feels that peculiar happinessWhich comes from loved old things.Borges, as we know, kept on losing his eyesight with age however this gradually developing inability seems to worked as blessing in disguise for him- more importantly for the world, for it seemed to have developed his imagination to manifold and might have triggered his metaphorical sensibility; the poem ‘In praise of darkness’ seems to be inspired by this and in fact seems to celebrate the blindness as the title suggests. The diminishing ability, to see outward appears to instill trend to introspect himself, to use memory like his notebook. The influence of Democritus, Emerson, Dante could be seen in the poem as the poet gradually become oblivious of his surroundings and eventually reaches his origin. The idea appears to similar to the idea of enlightenment propagated by ‘Yog’ culture and Buddhism. Excerpts from  In Praise of Darkness:Old age (the name that others give it)Can be the time of our greatest bliss.The animal has died or almost died.The man and his spirit remain.I live among vague, luminous shapesThat are not darkness yet. ………..My friends have no faces,Women are what they were so many years ago,These corners could be other corners,There are no letters on the pages of books.All this should frighten me,But it is a sweetness, a return.Of the generations of texts on earthI will have read only a few-The ones that I keep reading in my memory,Reading and transforming.……………………….These paths were echoes and footsteps,Women, men, death-throes, resurrections,Days and nights,Dreams and half wakeful dreams,Every inmost moment of yesterdayAnd all the yesterdays of the world,The Dante’s staunch sword and the Persian’s moon,The acts of the deadShared love, and words,Emerson and snow, so many things.Now I can forget them. I can reach my center,My algebra and my key,My mirror.Soon I will know who I am.These poems seem to blur the boundary between different literary genres as rightly mentioned by Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz :  'He cultivated three genres: the essay, the poem, and the short story. The division is arbitrary. His essays read like stories, his stories are poems; and his poems make us think, as though they were essays.'  As, Borges himself ‘declares’ in the prologue of In Praise of DarknessExcerpts from prologue of  In Praise of Darkness:In these pages I believe that the forms of prose and verse coexist without discord. I might invole illustrious precedents- Boethius’De philosophiae, Chaucher’s tales, The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments,  but I would prefer to declare that the differences between prose and verse are slight and that I would like this book to be read as a book of poems.One of themes Borges explored in the poems is history, he seemed to be deeply impressed by the anthropological history of human kind, and to me his fascination seems to be very similar to idea of structural anthropology which modern anthropologist such as Claude Lévi- Strauss explore.Excerpts from prologue of  The unending Rose:Literature starts out from poetry and can take centuries to arrive at the possibility of prose. After hour hundred years, the Anglo- Saxons left behind a poetry which was not just occasionally admirable and a prose which was scarcely explicit. The word must have been in the beginning a magic symbol, which the usury of time wore out. The mission of a poet should be to restore to the word, at least in a partial way, its primitive and now secret force. All verse should have tow obligations: to communicate a precise instance and to touch us physically, as the presence of the sea does.   Borges can sometimes be difficult and puzzling - he read vastly across the literature of different cultures, and his work is full of allusions and references to these works - but he also has a great gift for compressed, powerful expression, evoking an entire world of thought or feeling in a few beguiling lines of verse or a two-page short story. Borges uses a lot of history in this poem, not specifically Argentine culture; but French, European, Greek, etc. He also mentions Zeno, a Greek Philosopher, and Pascal, a French philosopher. Borges talks about sacrifices made to the gods, another piece of historical information.", rating: 4, book_id: 15, user_id: 26 },
  {title: "Brief form", review: "Yes, Oliver still wants more, is still taken in by Fagin, still loses Nancy and is still adopted by Mr Brownlow. So Dickens would have been pleased at this retelling of his classic story as, even in its briefest form, it retains all the salient action.Oliver Twist, or The Parish Boy's Progress as it was also known, is Charles Dickens' second novel and it was first published in serial form between February 1837 and April 1839. The story is of the orphan Oliver Twist, who loses his mother at his birth, is looked after by a woman for a time and then is taken to a workhouse by Mr Bumble. It is there that he shocks everyone by asking for more food, which results in him being locked up in a dismal cell for weeks.He is then rescued from the workhouse by Mr Sowerby, an undertaker for whom he works as an apprentice. But eventually Mr Sowerby decides to send him back to the workhouse but Oliver could not face that so he runs away to London. There he meets the Artful Dodger, a member of a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin to whom he is introduced and to whom he takes an instant dislike.Oliver is coerced into assisting in stealing property and is caught, seemingly in the act of stealing a watch from a Mr Brownlow. He ends up in court but just as he is going to be declared guilty a bookseller rushes into the court room to declare that he saw that Oliver was not the guilty party. Mr Brownlow comes to the rescue and escorts Oliver from the courtroom.Meanwhile Fagin and his gang are not happy that Oliver has disappeared after being in court and fear that he might talk about their activities. So Fagin employs Bill Sikes to find Oliver, which he does with the aid of Nancy. Sikes takes Oliver out of London and abandons him in a ditch from where he is discovered and eventually taken back to Mr Brownlow.When Oliver recovers, Nancy agrees to help him and the authorities to find Fagin and his gang but Sikes gets wind of what she is up to and shoots her dead - but not before she has spilt the beans. The climax comes when Sikes falls off a roof as he flees and Fagin is arrested, tried and sent to the gallows.Meanwhile Oliver lives happily with Mr Brownlow, who adopts him as his own. And there ends the tale that Charles Dickens would have delighted at being retold in this sympathetic and very readable way.", rating: 3, book_id: 12, user_id: 27 },
  {title: "FINAL REVIEW", review: "FINAL REVIEWAndre Dubus 1936-1999, Storyteller par exellenceMany of us involved with books – reading books, writing books, reviewing books - are well aware fiction writing is a unique calling. Therefore, it is something special when both father and son are accomplished authors. Kingsley Amis and son Martin come immediately to mind as do John Updike and son David; actually, we might think of another father-son fiction writing duo: Andre Dubus and son Andre Dubus 111, author of “House of Sand and Fog.”This collection of stories by Andre Senior that's part of the 1980s Vintage Contemporaries series is really a treasure since it would be hard to find someone more a born storyteller. Remarkable. Twenty-three slice-of-life stories, some brief, some long, ranging from five pages to fifty pages that flow and flow and flow. We find a story about a catcher from the Dominican Republic who has a psychic breakdown in the locker room after a ballgame, a fight between husband and wife seen through the eyes of their teenage son, a young Puerto Rican wife reliving her husband being shot dead on a hill in Korea, a husband apologizing to his wife over breakfast after giving her a black eye the previous night when he was drunk, rawboned stories of the wounded heart, stories reminding me at times of Raymond Carver and at other times of Anton Chekov. Here’s my synopsis of two: They Now Life in TexasA woman is too intoxicated to drive back to her rural Texas home at night in the snow so she leaves the driving to her husband who is also intoxicated but not enough that he can’t hunch over the steering wheel and slowly guide their car back up the hill to their front door. During the drive, in the darkness, snow piled high on either side of the road, she lets her husband know that adult son Stephen told her about his religious experience. Still hunched over the steering wheel, not taking his eyes off the road, her husband notes the religious experience must have worked since he knocked off the booze and started going to AA. Once in their driveway, she asks her husband to please drive the sitter home, which he does. Alone, she walks down the hall to check on her four-year-old daughter who is sleeping amongst her stuffed bears and then moves to the room of her older daughter, a six-years-old, and observes how she is also asleep, snuggled up with her three beloved stuffed animals. The woman sits in the kitchen drinking tea when her husband returns and asks her how she’s doing and, half asleep, shuffles off to bed. Alone again, she walks to the living room and reflects on the movies her husband brought home for her to watch: “Man of Flowers,” which she thought beautiful and “Lucia di Lammermoor,” a movie she found both splendid and sad. The one she did not watch is a horror film.She loads the horror film in the player and settles in after fixing herself more tea. The film is about a divorced woman living in Southern California with her fourteen-year-old daughter, twelve-year-old son and another daughter, age nine. Some unknown presence, something like a poltergeist, attacks the woman at night, a presence she feels as a sinister force.The unknown force increases, causing violence to not only the mother but also her three children. The woman sips her tea and reflects on the past conversation she had with her adult son Stephen, how he told her that he heard a voice when driving his car, how he then felt a loving presence enter him and how he surrendered to this presence which gave him the strength to quit drinking. Watching the mother in the movie start to cry, the woman also starts crying. When we learn on the last page the movie is based on true events, we realize the woman in the horror film and the woman in our story might, in fact, be one and the same person. The CurseMitchell Hayes stands at the cash register at the bar and reflects on how he is forty-nine years old and now knows what it means to be an old man. He is brooding because he helplessly looked on the previous night when a gang of thugs hopped up on coke raped an attractive blonde young lady in a bathing suit who happened to stroll into the bar to get cigarettes from the cigarette machine. The gang raped her right there on the floor of the bar, right before his very eyes and he couldn’t do a thing about it; and if he tried, he would have been beaten senseless. After the gang left Mitchell uses the phone to call 911. When the police arrive, including Smiitty, a guy he knew since they both went to the same high school in this small town, Mitchell tells him he could have stopped the rape. Smitty, in turn, tells Mitchell it is a good thing he didn’t try or he would be in the hospital right now. Mitchell goes home and tells his wife, a nurse, what happened at the bar. She rubs his shoulders and back, sensing just how shaken he is by the experience. The next morning Mitchell also tells his teenage son Marty and teenage daughter Joyce, how the girl was crying and taken to the hospital and all the gang members are now in jail. The next night Mitchell returns to the bar and watches the faces of all the men and women, watches to see if any of them look at him as if to say that he was a coward or didn’t care enough for the girl to do something to stop the rape. No. Nobody says anything or is looking at him in that way. Mitchell peers down at the floor, at the spot where the girl was raped. He feels old and tired. Mitchell now thinks back at how the girl was lying there after the gang left, how she was crying, how he wanted to at least hold her hand but he didn’t. Most of all, Mitchell thinks back at what the girl said to him, words he took as a curse, a curse he now feels moving into his back and spreading down his spine and into his stomach and legs and arms and shoulders, a curse we know as readers he will be hearing every day for the remainder of his life.", rating: 5, book_id: 16, user_id: 28 },

  {title: "Review", review: "Review  Black Beauty by Anna Sewell is a beautiful story meant for older children or very young adults. It was written in the 19th century by a woman who passed away shortly after its publication. I enjoyed the story and have given it a 3 of 5 stars, which is still very good in my book.A few interesting things:1. The point of view in the book is from Black Beauty, the horse.2. It takes place in London nearly 150 years ago.3. It's still a cherished story for both pleasure reading and education purposes.I received it as a gift when I was about 8 or 9, as I had asked for several 'classics' for Christmas. When I saw the cover, I thought it looked pretty. But not enough to read it. It sat on my shelf for probably two years until one day, I said 'let's just give it a chance.' I was afraid it would be too boring... I've always preferred complex plots and strong characters. I wasn't sure this would really work for me. I was wrong!Seeing how people mistreated and misunderstood animals was a big benefit of the book. It opens your eyes to things from another perspective, and if it helps just a little to develop a bond between younger adults / children and animals, then it's served its purpose.It's one of those books everyone should read... but not as a forced school assignment. It should be something parents want to share with their kids around 7 or 8... teaching them about how to be respectful and kind to all creatures. And then take them horseback riding to see what it's actually like. That's what I did when I finished it... went with a small group of friends to a riding academy / farm a few towns over and learned about horses for one summer. I kinda miss riding... maybe I should try it again. Off topic again... what is up with me today on these reviews! About Me  For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

  {title: "Choked", review: "Chuck Chandler choked on the most important point of his career as a professional tennis player. Through the years that followed, he's been slipping gradually down through the ranks, and now, at forty-four, he's reduced to giving tennis lessons at a small club in Key West. Chuck lost his last job by playing around with the wife of the club's chairman, but having not learned his lesson, he's soon involved with another married woman in Key West, the sexy and mysterious Clare Carras.Tommy Sculley is also new to Key West. The retired NYPD homicide detective has taken a job on the Key West force and Sculley is immediately interested in Clare's older husband, Harry. Sculley thinks that there's something off about Harry and begins checking out his background. The problem is that Harry seems to have no background at all--it's as though he simply materialized out of thin air. But then Harry winds up dead, and the obvious suspect is Chuck Chandler who's been sleeping with Harry's wife.The story unfolds from that point with a lot of twists and turns, some of which are more believable than others. The plot is not especially fresh, and the characters are somewhat thinly drawn. But the story moves quickly along, catching the reader up in the action. As a genre novel, this is a good quick read, just about right for a lazy summer day at the beach.", rating: 3, book_id: 3, user_id: 30 },
  {title: "My literary crush", review: "Wally Stegner...sigh...my literary crush. There are 31 stories in this collection, written over a period of about 50 years. Naturally, the subject matter and quality varies. Stegner himself chose the stories for inclusion, as well as their arrangement in the collection. He clearly knew his best writing, because the better stories are in the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the book. In the Foreword, Stegner says about the stories: 'I lived them, either as a participant or spectator or auditor, before I made fictions of them...and because the world and I were changing at an ever accelerating rate, some stories reflect events, social attitudes, and even diction that now seem dated.' Yes! This is what makes the collection worth reading. It covers so many time periods and lifestyles that are forever gone, preserved in literary amber by one who actually lived through those bygone eras. The stories cover a variety of historical topics: the 1918 influenza epidemic, WWII wives waiting for letters from their soldier husbands, ranching life on the plains of Saskatchewan, and Prohibition days in Salt Lake City. All from someone who was there. I think the most perfect story in the collection is 'Double Corner.' It showcases Stegner's talent for creating a powerful sense of place, as well as his ability to express the beautiful and heartbreaking impulses that make us human. If you read no other stories in this book, at least read this one. 'Double Corner' is about a little family of California fruit growers who try to take on the task of caring for the husband's mother rather than placing her in an old folks' home. But the mother has dementia, and all their love and good intentions may not be enough to keep her safe and keep themselves from falling apart. Stegner lets us see how difficult it is for everyone when a loved one is losing mental faculties, and how frightening life becomes for the one with dementia. 'Grandma's mind was a terrified little animal trembling in a dark hole while danger walked outside.'I also really liked 'Volcano,' a very short piece that takes place in Mexico. It's an excellent example of writing to show rather than just tell.", rating: 5, book_id: 5, user_id: 31 },
  {title: "Sample", review: "”’You have to be taken in--if Precrime is to survive. You’re thinking of your own safety. But think, for a moment, about the system.’ Leaning over, Lisa stubbed out her cigarette and fumbled in her purse for another. ‘Which means more to you---your own personal safety or the existence of the system?’‘My safety,’ Anderton answered, without hesitation.‘You’re positive?’‘If the system can survive only by imprisoning innocent people, then it deserves to be destroyed. My personal safety is important because I’m a human being.’” If you think about someone who looks the exact opposite of Tom Cruise, you will know what John Allison Anderton looked like in Philip K. Dick’s mind.With wives like Lisa, who needs enemies?John Allison Anderton’s day begins with the arrival of a snot nosed kid by the name of Ed Witwer. He has been assigned to Precrime to eventually replace Anderton whenever he decides to retire. The system is based on three Precogs who can foresee the future. They are able to see a crime before it is committed. When two or more agree, it is called a majority report, but if one disagrees with the other two, that is a minority report. Anderton designed the system, but even he has some qualms about the validity of what they do. ”’So the commission of a crime itself is absolute metaphysics. We claim they are culpable. They, on the other hand, eternally claim they’re innocent. And, in a sense, they are innocent.’‘In our society we have no major crimes, Anderton went on, ‘but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals.’” When Anderton pulls the latest cards from the Precogs and finds his name among them, stipulating that he is going to kill someone next week he doesn’t even know, he knows that he is being framed. He has no choice but to go on the run and hide until the week has passed and, in the process, prove the error of the forecasting, but if he does that, he also proves the system is flawed. There are people who most definitely don’t want that to happen. He soon finds he can’t trust anyone, and maybe the very person he trusts the least is his only hope at discovering and exposing the truth. There are obviously differences between the short story and the movie. I enjoy both and don’t have a problem that Steven Spielberg deviates and updates the concepts that Philip K. Dick came up with in 1956. Spielberg embraces the technological advances that have occurred in the last 46 years and is able to anticipate more accurately what the near future would look like. I caught just about ten minutes of the movie the other day and stopped watching it because I realized I was way overdue to watch the complete movie again, but it did remind me that I’d never read the original inspiration for the movie. For those who are fans of the movie, you will meet a different world in the short story, but what always fascinates me is how the original story influences a director, an artist, or another writer, and therefore escapes the boundaries of the creator.

  {title: "Shorts", review: "The selected shorts here include Forster's fantasies, which, at least according to the forward, he didn't seem to think as serious as his novels. But they're just as worthy a read. There's a playful feel to these, which vary in genre from sci-fi to standard literature. But the theme that runs through all of them is this idea of living, of how we live or, more often, don't live. In The Celestial Bus, in which I couldn't help envisioning Harry Potter and the Dudley's, there's the not-new idea that we lose our imagination as we become adults, but Forster gives it new life by transporting us readers to a magical land in the sky. In the Machine Stops, Forster paints a bleak automated picture of a future where we all live in rooms under the Earth's surface where our every need is met and we only talk to others via computers. Wait. Na, it's not that bad yet. I once read that E.M. Forster said or his favored theme was 'always connect' and in this story he presents a world where there is very little human contact or connection and tries to show the price of losing it. To be honest, this story ended up feeling a little dry to me. Forster's real talent is in showing new insights into characters and even finding beauty in their shortcomings. He loses it a little here with characters that feel more automated. My favorite story in this collection is The Road from Colonus. It plays with an idea I keep thinking about as I watch my grandmother get older and struggle to remember things and do things - there's such a push to do whatever it takes to live forever that we don't do anything because we're just trying not to die ever. In the story an older man on vacation with his daughter and her friends wants to stop and live in a village in Greece, where he feels part of things, he's alive again, to use the cliched term. But the daughter rushes him on, he can't stay there, it's not appropriate, the Greeks are barbarians, he must be back in London for the daily routine of things, etc. etc. With the ending, Forster captures the way we preserve life so much so that life is maybe not worth saving.", rating: 4, book_id: 16, user_id: 33 },
  {title: "Aristophanes", review: "This collection contains all eleven of Aristophanes' surviving comedies. Nowhere else are you likely to discover what the Athenian Man in the Street is thinking during the Peloponnesian War. At one point, in Plutus, we have a list of the things that the average Athenian craved the most. They included, in order: loaves, literature, sweets, honor, cheesecakes, manliness, dried figs, ambition, barley meal, command, and pea soup. The two main themes that run across the comedies are a strong desire for peace (The Acharnians and Peace) and women taking over because the men have made such a hash of things (Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusae). Socrates is taken down a peg in The Clouds; and we learn that making all good men wealthy can have untoward side-effects in Plutus. We hear men, women, gods, servants, housebreakers, scroungers, and even birds speak their minds.I wish there were more current translations in this collection, which was first published in 1962, but, unfortunately, that is not likely in today's book-publishing environment. Still, the collection is edited by Moses Hadas, one of the great classicists of yesteryear. And old translations can be just as readable as newer ones, even if the language is more archaic.If you have any interest in ancient Greece, this is a collection you must own and dip into from time to time, if for no other reason than to remind you that the men and women of Periclean Athens were human beings, just like you and me.", rating: 5, book_id: 17, user_id: 34 },

That reflects upon my priorities in my early 20s. Hey, I should spend money on a new book I won't read for decades. Such memory isn't necessarily wistful, just peculiar. Char creates a series of challenging images. Some are steeped in the privation of the Occupation, some appear bucolic.

  {title: "Prefatory note", review: "Prefatory note: as explained below, the publishing history of Robert Graves's poetic work is rather chaotic. One result of this is that if you search for the particular edition of the book I am reviewing and recommending here on Goodreads under either its full title or its ISBN, you will get what is in fact another edition. But I am attaching the review to this edition, since apparently the edition I am actually reviewing here is not included in Goodreads records. The edition I am reviewing is Robert Graves The Complete Poems,, edited by Beryl Graves and Dunstan Ward (Penguin Modern Classics,) 944 pages, Penguin Books, Limited (UK) 2003, ISBN 13: 987-0-14-118206-3. The foregoing information is from the actual book which I have open before me (I note the title on the inside title page is Robert Graves The Complete Poems in One Volume, while the title on the book cover and spine is Robert Graves The Complete Poems.) You can see a picture of the cover on the Amazon record here.Though Robert Graves is known to the reading public primarily for his prose writings - historical novels (I, Claudius,) autobiography (Good-Bye to All That,) and mythology (Greek Myths, The White Goddess,) -- he always insisted that he was essentially a poet. His poetic output was substantial -- this Penguin Modern Classics Robert Graves: the Complete Poems in One Volume runs to more than 800 pages -- and its excellence generally recognized: he was honored with an appointment as Oxford Professor of Poetry (generally considered one of the most prestigious recognitions in British poetry,) and the noted critic Martin Seymour-Smith judged him 'the best love poet of his generation.' In addition to love poems, Graves's work includes humor, epigrams, songs, story poems, and many pieces reflecting his interest in classical, Celtic, and other mythologies. So his poetry will be especially interesting to those interested in those subjects, but can also be recommended to a broader audience for its overall excellence. The attractiveness of his poetry can be impressive even for readers unfamiliar with his often recondite subject matter: for example, poems like his Ibycus in Samos or The Sirens' Welcome to Cronos have a magic about them which should appeal even to readers who don't have the classical background to understand what they allude to.Despite this critical success, Graves's books have generally ill served his poetry. To understand this statement, and as background to the recommendation I'll be making in this review, it's useful to consider the usual way in which the work of major modern poets is published. Typically, when a poet has reached the peak of his or her career, their work is embodied in two, or sometime three, sorts of books. A 'Selected Poems' presents the best and most accessible poems for a general readership. A 'Collected Poems' is the definitive statement of all the poems the poet (or the poet's literary executors) want to preserve for posterity. And sometimes, additionally, a 'Complete Poems' is published, which includes not only everything in the 'Collected Poems,' but also additional material such as juvenilia, unpublished and posthumous poems, and significantly different revisions of poems, together with annotations of the poems publishing history. Such a 'Complete Poems' is usually aimed at scholars of the poet's work.The publishing of Graves's poetry has followed this pattern only approximately and with complex variations. During his lifetime, he published numerous subsets of his poems under various titles, some of them called 'Selected Poems.' He also published three different volumes called 'Collected Poems,' but again, none of these was really a definitive statement of his best work. Finally, after his death, Beryl Graves, the poet's widow, and Graves scholar Dunstan Ward, compiled 1) yet another Collected Poems, published by Carcanet in 2000, 2) a Robert Graves: Complete Poems in three volumes, published by Carcanet in 1995 - 1999, and 3) this Robert Graves: the Complete Poems in One Volume, published by Carcanet in 2000, and republished as a Penguin Modern Classics paperback in 2003. To complicate things further, there exist at least two other books called'Selected Poems,' one published in 1992 by Penguin, which is apparently a revision by Graves of one of his earlier selections and seems to be out of print, and another edited by Michael Longley published by Faber in 2012, which apparently is still in print. And there may be yet others I'm not aware of.So, out of this complicated situation, if you want a Graves poetry book, which to choose? First, it can be said that of the above listed volumes, none of Graves's own editions published during his lifetime is really a proper 'Selected,' 'Collected,' or 'Complete Poems' in the sense described. Of the collections published later by others, I haven't seen the three volume Complete Poems, but reviews indicate that it is clearly designed for professional scholars, and is therefore likely to be too much, and too expensive, for general readers. I likewise haven't seen the Carcanet Collected Poems of 2000, but research indicates that it is out of print, hard to find, and is likely to be outrageously expensive if you can find it. Nor have I yet seen the new Faber Selected Poems, but from the table of contents available via Amazon's preview, it seems like a good selection. I may review it separately eventually.This leaves us with this Penguin Modern Classics Robert Graves: the Complete Poems in One Volume, which I can recommend enthusiastically to all readers. The book is attractively produced, includes all of Graves's published poems and a good selection of unpublished ones, and is readily available and fairly priced. There is a brief but useful introduction on the poet's life and work, and the usual indexes of titles and first lines.Since I haven't seen it, I can't in good conscious at present make a recommendation for the Faber Selected Poems, but the table of contents indicates it may be a good choice for those who want a compact (176 pp.) volume. But since this Penguin Modern Classics Robert Graves: the Complete Poems in One Volume costs only a few dollars more and gives you everything, it's the one I'd recommend getting for all current and potential readers of Graves's poetry. For readers who may be daunted upon being confronted with the book's some 1,200 poems, here is my personal recommendation of a couple dozen which I think would be a good introduction to Graves's poetry:Ulysses, To Juan at the Winter Solstice, The White Goddess, She Tells Her Love While Half Asleep, Sick Love, Lovers in Winter, The Clipped Stater, Inkadoo and the Queen of Babylon, Amergin's Charm, The Song of Blodeuwedd, Down Wanton Down, Midwinter Waking, Rhea, Pure Death, Lament for Pasiphae, Ibycus in Samos, Instructions to the Orphic Adept, Warning to Children, The Weather of Olympus, A Civil Servant, The Sirens' Welcome to Cronos, A Love Story, The Quiet Glades of Eden, In the Wilderness, Mid-Winter Waking.", rating: 5, book_id: 17, user_id: 35 },

  {title: "He read poetry", review: "When an interviewer once asked Ray Bradbury what he did to prepare to write every day, he answered, “I read poetry.”He read poetry, to write prose.It made me want to read more poetry than I already do, and it also inspired me to find new poets, too. I recently came home from the library with a stack (and I mean a stack) of new-to-me poetry, and I've been saturating myself with it ever since. It's amazing what poetry does to your mind. It sharpens it, almost immediately. When I have a daily practice, I feel more connected to both my emotional life and my environment.I read poetry out loud, and I typically pace the room as I do; it's a quirky habit that I've always had. Has something to do with reading rhythm, I believe.I am having so much fun with this, but I've also found deficiencies in my practice. For example, I have realized that I favor male poets and have overlooked quite a few female poets, despite being one myself.In researching more poets, I discovered that Edna St. Vincent Millay was born just two years before my favorite poet, EE Cummings, and just four years after one of my other favorites, T.S. Eliot. They would have been in high school together, so to speak. Seemed like a obvious choice, to pick a woman who was a peer of two of my favorite guys.But, Millay doesn't write like her male peers at all. In fact, she often uses language that feels like it's from a much different time, like elegant rhyming couplets and rhyming alternating lines. But. . . you can't dismiss her as “traditional” either. Given when she was writing, her subjects are bold and progressive and she is not timid at all about dissecting the human heart. She writes with a dramatic flourish, and after reading the first 10 poems in this famous collection, I went ahead and ordered myself my own copy. This is a HUGE collection. I'll be reading from this for the rest of my life. I'd love to include her famous Renascence here, but it's 11 pages long. So, I'll just leave you with a short poem that reminded me of a bad break-up I had in college that prompted a 6 month jag of cigarettes and Sinead O'Connor's 'Nothing Compares 2 U.' Universal suffering, baby. Poetry always captures it:I know what my heart is likeSince your love died:It is like a hollow ledgeHolding a little poolLeft there by the tide,A little tepid pool,Drying inward from the edge.", rating: 5, book_id: 4, user_id: 37 },
  {title: "Highly recommended", review: "Veronica by Mary Gaitskill came very highly recommended. It was on a lot of 'best of' lists and I'd actually had it on my list of 'To Read' for a while. This was a book that I couldn't finish and that is a real dilemma for me. When I'm not enjoying a book at all, I never know whether to quit or keep going. If I don't like it early on, I feel like I owe it to at least give it a chance, and keep reading. Eventually I'm half-way through and even if I still don't like it, I'm like, 'Well, I'm half-way through now....' But this one I finally just put down. It's the story of a women who had been a model in Europe, fell from grace, contracted Hepatitis, and met an older, slightly crazier woman named Veronica in NYC, who died from AIDS. The story wasn't really about Veronica, though, it was about the infected former-model. I think eventually, further toward the end, we would have learned more about how Veronica influenced the other girl's life, or something. Reviews praise the writing as 'poetic' but I thought it was flowery and weird and hard to follow.

  {title: "Review", review: "since feeling is firstwho pays any attention to the syntax of thingswill never wholly kiss you;'It's a stroke of luck that this is the first E.E. Cummings book I'd get my hands on, seeing as it contains small introductions by Richard S. Kennedy. Without those introductions I would have been lost. Honestly. As much as I have relished and soaked myself in Cummings' poetry, I could as easily have drowned and never been found. I am thankful I didn't. There are some of his poems I simply don't get, and some it took me very long to decipher. To the untrained eye some of what he writes is absolute gibberish. And some I'm not sure I'll ever train my eye well enough to make sense of, which is why I'm only giving this otherwise amazing book 4 stars. I don't really dig having my poetry-readings resemble a National Treasure movie. BUT, when I get E.E. Cummings (sometimes more easily than others) I love him, and I think his style and his insights are works of genius. I am particularly in love with how he uses the words themselves and these incredible grammatical distortions as living things - not just tools, to make his stories and sentences come to life. The words - even devoid of meaning - tell a story. Every comma, and parenthesis, tells a story. It also struck me how his writing reminded me, in places, of my own. Especially when it comes to using parenthesis'. I fucking love a good parenthesis. It is the one grammatical device I am emotionally attached to (it has a very special meaning for me). And the way it is used by Cummings is heavenly. So I recommend this book. The style is singular and perhaps you won't like it or understand anything at first, but I beg you to keep going - embrace it - keep your head above the water and swim like hell, you will reach land and it will be worth it. He had an extraordinary mind and a way with words I am inadvertently taken with. Here, have a few examples, and be convinced!:'pity this busy monster,manunkind,not' (manunkind is the most magnificent play on words)or 'nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands' a favourite line of mine, I love the idea of the rain having small hands - perhaps then getting soaked is an embrace?These don't even begin to touch the variety or beauty and wit of the poems in this book - there's a very wide selection, both in themes and in style, so if you feel you want to get to know E.E. Cummings (a pursuit I can only recommend) this is a good place to start.", rating: 4, book_id: 15, user_id: 40 },
  {title: "My favorite by this author", review: "I haven't read the entire anthology, but this one is my favorite poem by this author, who also wrote Tess of the D'Urbervilles:Now I am dead you sing to meThe songs we used to know,But while I lived you had no wishOr care for doing so.Now I am dead you come to meIn the moonlight, comfortless;Ah, what would I have given aliveTo win such tenderness!When you are dead, and stand to meNot differenced, as now,But like again, will you be coldAs when we lived, or how?All those traditions honoring the death are symbolic and fulfilling to those who practice them, but it is just not something for me. I really like this poem because it explains how I feel about the topic of dead loved ones. My Christian mother often urges me to go to the cemetery to visit my deceased grandmother. She reminded me that I haven't visited grandma in years and that I ought to do so. She forgets that I am atheist and that I believe in investing one's time on the living, not on the dead.I loved my grandmother more than anybody. She was one of the greatest influences in my life and I owe so much to her. I do remember her often, laugh over anecdotes related to her, quote her, and release tears of despair during times when I wish she was here with me. However, I am happy she lived a long, happy, and healthy life. She had her turn on this planet and she used it well. I would have done anything for her while she was alive. Now, however, no matter what I do for her I know it will be useless because she no longer exists and her reality is simply one of darkness and nothingness. Therefore, I told my mother that I'd rather do something enjoyable with my time than go visit my grandmother's remains.All those traditions honoring the death are symbolic and fulfilling to those who practice them, but it is just not something for me. I really like this poem because it explains how I feel about the topic of dead loved ones. I shared it with my mom and she really liked it too.", rating: 4, book_id: 4, user_id: 41 },

  {title: "This book pissed me off!", review: "Have you ever read a book that really pissed you off? Pissed you off so much all you could do was rant about it until everyone told you to just shut up? This is that book for me.Picoult's dialogue is excellent, but her characters annoy me and the ending of this book was such a cop-out I almost wrote her an angry letter about it, but decided against it, as she'd never read it anyway.Basically, 'My Sister's Keeper' is about a family with three kids - I forget their real names, so I'm giving them fake ones: Token Boy Child, Leukemia, and Spare Parts. Mom and Dad find out about Leukemia's unfortunate diagnosis when she's just two, so they decide to have another baby - not to replace Leukemia when she inevitably bites it, but to provide Leukemia with spare parts for organ transplants. Spare Parts gets tired of being held back by her sister's needs - and in turn, Leukemia gets tired of holding her sister back; Spare Parts isn't allowed to go to overnight camp and is being forced to quit playing her favorite sport because Leukemia needs a new kidney. Spare Parts goes to a lawyer in an attempt to get medical emancipation from her parents. She winds up winning it, but dies in a car crash. Mom pulls the plug immediately, Leukemia gets a new kidney, and - even better - Leukemia is magically cured of her illness altogether. Also, there was a stupid subplot about the lawyer and social worker falling in love.The mother character annoyed me the most here; she didn't love her daughters equally, and it showed. It really showed. She loved Leukemia the way you love a child. She loved Spare Parts the way you love that child's trust fund or college savings. She played favorites and made no attempt to hide it.This whole book infuriated me - the very idea of having another kid just so your sick child can have her own personal organ bank sickens me. It really does. You're supposed to have a child because you will love that child, not to fill the needs of another child.", rating: 3, book_id: 10, user_id: 43 },

If you like it, you're an idiot who's too easily amused, and if you hate it, Chuck Palahniuk is just laughing at you, going, 'Dude, I told you.' You can't win. Chuck Palahniuk seems like the type of author who thrives on negative responses. The man's probably wallpapered his bathroom with all the reviews trashing his books, and every morning he looks at them and cackles maniacally while he takes a shit. He doesn't write books for entertainment, or to make you think, or to (god forbid!) preach a moral or a message. Chuck Palahniuk is that kid on the playground who dug up bugs and shoved them in girls' faces just to see them run away screaming. His goal is to offend people, shock them, and just plain gross them out. Not much else. Choke is a little more disgusting than Fight Club, and much, much less disgusting than Haunted. That's pretty much all I can say. So why am I giving this book four stars?Good question. I'm kind of wondering that myself.

He was an old man with white hair and gold-rimmed glasses, curiously dressed in a lace-embroidered doublet and a periwig, and he was carrying a book.'Greetings,' said the visitor. 'I think you should read this.'What is it?' asked Manny irritably. People were always asking him to read things. 'I don't really have time right now. I need to get this software problem fixed for tomorrow. And then I have an article to write and a dozen emails to answer and some insurance paperwork I've been putting off for too long. I'm very busy. How did you get in, anyway?'It definitely sounds like you should read Momo,' said the old man, ignoring Manny's question. 'I am quite concerned about you. Here, take a look.'Manny flicked through it briefly and sighed. 'It's some kind of YA fantasy novel, right?' he said. 'If that is what you want to call it,' replied the visitor.'But I don't read YA,' said Manny. 'All my friends know that.'Why not?' asked the visitor.'Well, I'm too old for it,' said Manny, as he studied the error message his laptop was showing him. 'I find it painfully unsophisticated and badly written. It never gives me anything.'Perhaps you should become younger,' said the visitor. 'It's quite easy, you know.'Really?' said Manny in a dismissive tone. But something made him glance up from his screen, and he saw to his surprise that the visitor was no longer an old man. In fact, he almost looked like a child.'You see?' said the visitor. 'Now, here's what you need to do. Just learn German. At first, you'll be a helpless infant and you won't be able to read at all. Soon, though, you'll find you're four or five and enjoying stories. When you're about ten, you'll be ready for this. I'll come back when you've finished.'You must be joking,' said Manny, who was looking at his screen again. 'Didn't I just tell you I was very busy?' He turned around, but found his visitor had disappeared. All that was left was a large pile of German children's books.Over the next few months, Manny somehow found himself reading one German book after another. He read Grimms Märchen, and Krabat, and Das doppelte Lottchen, and Madita, and Karlsson vom Dach. Finally, a couple of weeks before Christmas, he opened Momo. He found he couldn't put it down. He had just finished the last chapter when he heard someone clear their throat behind him. 'Well?' said the visitor. 'I hope you're not too busy to talk to me?'Uh, no,' said Manny. 'It's funny, but when I think about it I find I have more time than I'd imagined. And you're right. Momo is very good.'I'm glad to hear it,' said the visitor gravely.'There was just something I wanted to ask you,' said Manny. 'Here, wait a moment.' He leafed through the book to find the page.

  {title: "Beautiful and optimistic", review: "One of the most beautiful and optimistic books I have ever read, The Life Before Us is a masterpiece. Romain Gary wrote it under a pseudonym, Emile Ajar, and thus became to only person to win the French Goncourt Prize twice. In fact, it was only after his tragic death that the identity of the mysterious but astounding write Ajar was revealed to by Romain Gary. The story is told my Momo, an infant of prostitution in an illegal boarding house run by the aging Madame Rosa, well past her prime but who still 'defended herself' from time to time. Momo lives with other children of prostitutes and is a fount of wisdom and consciousness that - despite his hilarious vocabulary of words used in the wrong sense but which reveal even more about his sensibility - surprises and amuses us at every turn of the page:'The first thing I can tell you is that we lived on the 6th floor without an elevator and for Madame Rosa with all those pounds she carried on only two legs, it was a real source of daily life, with all its worried and pains.'

  {title: "Shock of lightning ", review: "I’d like love to be like a shock of lightning; a bolt from heaven; an eagle-like thing, tearing my heart and feeding on my soul.Heron, the heroine of Violet Winspear's The Glass Castle soon regrets that rather savage wish for love, because no sooner has she thought it that it materializes in the form of Edwin Trequair, who makes no secret that he would gladly be the bird of prey that would catch and devour her. Your mouth is like Kate’s-scornful and scorning. Your slim neck has never bowed to a punishment or a pleasure-you’re a wild bird, cool as water. You know, it’s rather dangerous to dislike someone at first glance… as dangerous as loving someone at first sight. And it is true that she has visualized 'love as a pleasure close to pain… a passion near to tears… a joy with its heels in hell and its hopes in heaven.' So is Heron's instant fear and dislike of Edwin only her surface reaction and are her true feelings buried deep into her more primitive subconscious?The Glass Castle is filled with interesting themes and gorgeous imagery. The seashore in Heron's beloved birth place in the English countryside has a 'tang of sea mud and curling weeds and creatures in washed-up shells' and she loves to watch the horizon with her eyes that are 'silvery grey like the sea, and her hair tossed in the breeze like a bright banner.' London, on the other hand, is 'disfigured, like a charming woman ravished of her grace', its modern flats 'concrete geysers... designed in dark rooms, by men who dislike the human race. 'If Paris has the 'tang of wine and dark bread and love in long filmy stockings', poor London never smells clean, even after the rain, which only manages to make it 'smell like an old dog.' Edwin offers Heron an escape from all that grimness into his own, enchanted castle, the Victorian palace with glass turrets perched above Heron's beloved seashore. When she enters it for the first time though, the first thing she notices, unfortunately, is not the glittering light of the sky and water that is filtered through those glass turrets but the iron-cage newel that stands agape at the foot of the stairs as if waiting for her, for 'it was high enough for someone of Heron’s height to stand in. 'The abject terror, combined with fascination, that the heroine feels towards the hero makes this story play out like a dark fairy tale. Is the hero a Bluebeard, bent on luring the heroine to his lair and keeping her there in captivity? Will he cherish or destroy her once he has imprisoned her? Though Edwin lavishes rubies on the scarlet-maned, ivory-skinned Heron, do they denote his passion for her or symbolize the blood sacrifice that is intended to take place? References to her slim, white neck, as fragile as the petals of a lotus flower, or the neck of a wild heron, abound, so it is with some trepidation that the reader watches the hero cut the 'virginal wedding cake' with a jeweled kris sword, a weapon designed to follow the natural curve of a human neck and rumored to be acquired through no other means than the demise of its former owner. Alternatively, there could be the interpretation that the entire thing is not even reality but just a Freudian nightmare. Throughout the story, Heron is battling with repressed memories stemming from a traumatic, near-drowning that occurred when she was a child, living in her parents' estate named 'Memory.' The night that she meets Edwin, she is a young woman who long ago moved to the city and is now merely visiting 'Memory', which her uncle bought after the death of her parents. She feels the inexorable pull to revisit the scene of the accident and it is as she stands in the garden of 'Memory', by that very pond filled with the lotus flowers that had lured her there as a child, that Edwin, a guest at her uncle's party, forces her to acknowledge him. The glass castle that Edwin offers Heron as her marital home stands not too far from the 'Memory' estate and at one point, as she is once again wavering between the terror and the fulfillment of belonging to this man, she wonders if it is not too late for her to escape and just follow the path back to 'Memory' rather than go through the marriage.Even among the always fascinating works of Violet Winspear, The Glass Castle stands out as a veritable treasure trove of coded, evocative, lyrical imagery, prose, and romanticism. It may just as well be a horror story (with all the themes of captivity, domination, destruction, consummation) as it is an ultra-romantic fairy tale. Heron tries to shrug off the importance of love, telling Edwin that 'love isn't everything' but as always, he never lets her off the hook and replies immediately: -'It isn’t love if it isn’t everything.", rating: 4, book_id: 19, user_id: 48 },
  {title: "Unhappy?", review: "Either Tennessee Williams was a very unhappy gay man or he had a terrible opinion of queer life. His stories reflect a time in America when 'perversion' was the first word that popped into people's minds when the idea of two men loving each other came up. To allow yourself the love of a beautiful man was equal to losing innocence and turning into a monster. A happy end was impossible, unthinkable. A whole underworld, lit like a pulp novel scene, ties these stories together: drunks of all types, kind-hearted prostitutes, horny sailors, tubercular artists - everyone struggling through life as best as they can, living mostly in warm, brightly-lit cities in the South that hum with nostalgia, sex and tragedy.Every story seems to have one beautiful man or boy that is at the centre of everyone else's ruin. Sometimes, like the prodigious musician in 'The Resemblance Between a Violin Case and a Coffin', he's a boy that shines so brightly he can only mean death. At other times, these beautiful men are a procession of quick fucks that come and go in the lives of drunks killing time, with nothing better to do, like the ones in 'Two on a Party.' Unsurprisingly, these hot studs are not averse to beating up a 'queen' if they feel like it.Gay men who are not blessed with beauty, like the creep in 'Hard Candy', carry around sweets and pennies in their pockets so they can buy love from boys in dark, dingy cinemas. Or they hide behind curtains and live voyeuristically through other people's dramas, like the young gay boy in 'Three Players of a Summer Game.'The preface, written by Tennessee, plus an introduction by Gore Vidal, help to explain how the writer's sexuality and family (especially his drunk father and beloved sister and grandmother) played strong roles in his life. From the preface and the introduction you realize that Tennessee always used his lovers and family as a source of inspiration.", rating: 5, book_id: 5, user_id: 49 },
  {title: "A lot of work", review: "In my experience, one does not become a reader of William Faulkner so much as a student of William Faulkner. Reading his work is, well, a lot of work. I’m reminded of a person who is forced to attend an opera which is performed in a foreign language, in a historical setting, without the benefit of subtitles and the evening’s program. Faulkner’s art is similarly inaccessible, and I must admit that his stories initially irritated me in the same way a fat lady in a Viking costume, screeching on a stage in a foreign language, might annoy our novice opera-goer. To this day, I still read Faulkner with a pen and paper in hand, diagramming character relationships and the chronology of events as if I were a trying to an answer a question on the LSAT. More times that not, I find that I actually enjoy the second reading of his stories because I’m not so busy trying to figure such basic elements as who is speaking to whom.While Faulkner doesn’t write in Italian or German, he does like to make up his own English on occasion. Before you read his novels or Collected Stories, I recommend that you become familiar, if you aren’t already, with the words “anathema,” “apotheosis,” “sibilant,” and “effluvium.” He loves those. Also, please exercise extreme patience with his use of floating pronouns—that is, pronouns without apparent antecedents—especially in the opening pages of each story. It might take a few thousand words for you to discover the person whom “he” or “she” refers to, if you’re lucky. Finally, consider interjecting your own punctuation in sentences that last for more than a page or two. Remember that rule about limiting a sentence to one or two ideas? Neither does Faulkner. Part of the fun about Faulkner, and I’m not kidding, is figuring out what the hell is happening in the story; it’s seldom obvious. He creates this challenge both purposely and unintentionally. His stream-of-consciousness and nonlinear plotlines are, of course, intentional mystical effects. But his lack of dialogue attribution and his inability to visually orient a scene tend to nonplus the reader. Consider the opening of “The Leg.”The boat—it was a yawl boat with a patched weathered sail—made two reaches below us while I sat with the sculls poised, watching her over my shoulder, and George clung to the pile, spouting Milton at Everbe Corinthia. When it made the final tack I looked back at George. But he was now but well into Comus’ second speech, his crooked face raised, and the afternoon bright on his close ruddy head. “Give way, George,” I said. But he held us stationary at the pile, his glazed hat lifted, spouting his fine and cadenced folly as though the lock, the Thames, time and all, belonged to him, while Sabrina (or Hebe or Chloe or whatever name he happened to be calling Corinthia at the time) with her dairy-maid’s complexion and her hair like mead poured in sunlight stood above us in one endless succession of neat print dresses, her hand on the lever and one eye on George and the other on the yawl, saying “Yes, milord” dutifully whenever George paused for a breath.  The yawl luffed and stood away; the helmsman shouted for the lock. “Let go, George,” I said. But he clung to the pile in his fine and incongruous oblivion.  It goes without saying, then, that enjoying Faulkner isn’t a passive activity, at least not on the first reading (or diagramming). Before tackling his Collected Stories (a nine-hundred-page volume of veritable code) you should be forewarned that all of his novels, except one, were out of print until he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. Such irony underscores the premise that most people don’t read Faulkner so much as they study and appreciate him. Or perhaps they study him before they read him. I know I did. I didn’t truly enjoy Faulkner until I took a graduate class in which we slowly digested five of his novels: The Sound and The Fury (1929); As I Lay Dying (1930), Light in August (1932); Absalom, Absalom (1936); and Go Down Moses (1942).Collected Stories is comprised of forty-two short stories. In today’s publishing world, I dare say more than half of these short stories wouldn’t have made the final cut. Some of them, such as “A Justice,” “Red Leaves,” and “A Courtship,” might have worked better parceled together as a novella, since they focus on the same characters and story. Others, quite simply, are poorly crafted with unrealistic dialogue (in the sense that it replicates Fraulkner’s southern gothic narrative style and not how people speak) and too many characters, nameless and otherwise, for the medium of a short story, if not a novel. It’s like trying to conduct Mahler’s 8th Symphony in a public restroom. For example, his story “Fox Hunt” has no central character, yet there are several ancillary figures playing counterpoint to this nothingness, including “the old dame,” “the boy,” “the white man,” the youth,” the older man,” “the woman,” the man,” the man at the bay.” My God, Faulkner, give me somebody I can care about.Yet there are stories that are exceptionally well done, too. And while I don’t think any modern reader with a cable and internet subscription would attempt this entire volume without either 1) Having a gun at his head, or 2) an English paper due, I suspect that many of these stories, if anthologized or reduced to a compendium, might win Faulkner a few converts. I can safely recommend eleven of these stories: 1) “A Rose for Emily,” 2) “Dry September,” 3) “Victory,” 4) “The Evening Sun” 5) “Dr. Martino” 6) “Artist at Home,” 7) “The Brooch” 8) “Golden Land” 9) “Crevasse,” 10) “Two Soldiers,” and 11) “Barn Burning.” Contrary to popular thought, not all of Faulkner’s stories are set in the deep South. Of this collection, one is actually set in Beverly Hills and several others are set in Europe during the World War I era. What makes the above mentioned stories exceptional? What, in other words, allows them to overcome the dead weight of more than half of this volume to win the National Book Award? For one, Faulkner illuminates the psychological and moral depth and the emotional and intellectual complexity of many people who were previously stereotyped and marginalized, such as African Americans and Native Americans, if not southerners in general, be they poor or wealthy. That’s an award-winning service to America in and of itself. Secondly, Faulkner’s a damn good story-teller when he doesn’t let his writing get in the way. He reminds me of so many tragic heroes who have such outstanding strengths and weaknesses that the effect is nearly bipolar, like going on a trip with Dr. Jekyll—Mr. Hyde as your guide. Consequently, I both love and hate Faulkner, depending on whether the genius can hold the monster at bay. Sometimes the reader is mesmerized with phrases such as “old women dropsical with good living” or “the iron silence of winter.” At other times he pulls along so many adjectives and clauses that the meaning of his run-on sentence eventually derails whenever the plot takes a sharp turn. For example: “But the man did not seem to notice this, so they soon were talking in undertone, watching with bright, alert, curious eyes the stiff, incongruous figure leaning a little forward on the stick, looking out a foul window beyond which there was nothing to see save an occasional shattered road and man-high stump of shattered tree breaking small patches of tilled land whorled with apparent unreason about island of earth indicated by low signboards painted red, the islands inscrutable, desolate above the destruction which they wombed.” And that’s one of the small ones. Since some of Faulkner’s sentences run the length of a short story, I’m tempted to generalize that his rococo, serpentine style is more of a liability in the short story medium than in long fiction. I certainly enjoy his novels more than his short stories. Overall, Collected Stories has many gems, but you’ll have to dig for them. I think you’ll enjoy the story about Emily Griersen, a pitiful anachronism in the New South. You’ll like the irony found in “Victory,” and the genteel evil of “Dry September.” You’ll fear Jesus, a man with a razor, in “The Evening Sun,” and marvel at the psychological grip of physically frail characters such as Dr. Martino and Mrs. Boyd. Finally, you’ll be touched by the bond of brothers in “Two Soldiers” as well as the moral dilemma faced by a young boy in “Barn Burning.”", rating: 3, book_id: 5, user_id: 50 },
  {title: "I devoured it", review: "strings are incurably playing...the composer has stepped into fire.'I devoured The Complete Poems of Anne Sexton, whose poetry, especially her love poems, quivers with a pulsating eros as it sways to its orgiastic echoes. My nerves are turned on. I hear them likemusical instruments. Where there was silencethe drums, the strings are incurably playing. You did this.Pure genius at work. Darling, the composer has steppedinto fire. From 'The Kiss.'Hers was a tragic life, throughout most of which she suffered severe mental illness. Yet, by the late 1960s she was one of the most revered poets in America, having won the Pulitzer and being made the first female member of the Harvard chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.Her poetry seems most notable for the openness with which she wrote confessional poetry about topics still deemed taboo for open personal discussion such as incest, masturbation, menstruation, adultery and drug addiction. By the early 1970s, some critics saw her as a lazy boozy poetess. Others since have been kinder, saying that she had matured to the use her poems as an 'instrument against the 'politesse' of language, politics, religion [and] sex.' Rothenberg, Joris, Poems for the Millenium, 1995. A passage from another of my favorite poems, 'Eighteen Days Without You': Draw me good, draw me warm.Bring me your raw-boned wrist and yourstrange, Mr. Bind, strange stubborn horn.Darling, bring with this an hour of undulations, forthis is the music for which I was born.Lock in! Be alert, my acrobatand I will be soft wood and you the nailand we will make fiery ovens for Jack Spratand you will hurl yourself into my tiny jailand we will take a supper together and thatwill be that. At age 45, in October 1974, Ms. Sexton locked herself in her garage, started her car's engine and committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.Peter Gabriel obviously loved her poetry enough to write and dedicate to her a song called 'Mercy Street' on his 1986 album; a few lines: 'she pictures the broken glass, she pictures the steamshe pictures a soulwith no leak at the seam***dreaming of mercy streetwear your insides outdreaming of mercy***Anne, with her father is out in the boatriding the waterriding the waves on the sea.'Thank you to the publisher Open Road Integrated Media and NetGalley for a copy of this wonderful book in exchange for a fair review.", rating: 5, book_id: 17, user_id: 51 },

  {title: "Just okay", review: "This is my first Bellow read. Over the years I never bothered reading any of his books and overlooked them at the bookstores. This being my first volume was not that ecstatic.The presented anthology of 13 stories come with a mix bag of history, humor, irony, metaphysics, the Holocaust, nostalgia, sex, modernity, migrant life in America and identity ; accompanied by a witty narration. Most of the characters be it Samuel Braun, Rob Rexler, Harry Fonstein, Woody Selbst, Katrina Goliger or Max Zetland are not the epitome of beauty but are unique in their own imperfections. Bellow has an exceptional artistry in metamorphosing mediocrity to splendor. His several protagonists are sort of heroic who overcome life fragilities and emerge as winners in their own way. Most of them are Jewish or other immigrants trying to find their identity on the American soil; similar to what Bellow experienced during his life. These stories have a personal Bellow touch reflecting many of his own perspectives on identity (he fought the constant labeling of being a “Jewish writer”) and modernity. In ‘The Old System’, he mentions, “Mankind was in a confusing uncomfortable, disagreeable stage in the evolution of consciousness”, which shows his disheartening acceptation of modernity. These stories bring out the essence of beauty and joy from the most unconventional settings.That said and done, there are some disheartening shortcomings too. The narration is loose and needs trimming at certain edges, making it rather difficult to focus on the plot. The stories did have a solid start but somewhere in the middle it became a carnival of unexciting surroundings making me browse pages to find comfort. Also, Bellow’s portrayal of Sorella, Aunt Rose and even Max Zetland are filled with excessive and repetitive usage of adjectives to embellish human anatomy which tends to be a bit dragging. At times, I felt like erasing the characters from the highly subjective text.One thing I detest while reading short stories is skipping pages and this is exactly what I did here. I do not want to be unjust and form a rapid opinion about Bellow based on this writing .I don’t deny that he is one the superior writers but this book failed to create that aura. Hence, I will read some more of his works before inferring whether Bellow is my ‘cup of tea’.", rating: 3, book_id: 5, user_id: 53 },

I would only glance at the illustrations; but even so, I still didn't understand the story by just looking at it's illustrations. I really wanted to know the story, but every time I held the book in my hands I just couldn't get myself to read it.Then the time came that I finally learned to enjoy reading novels. I saw this book once more then I started reading it. When I was finally finished, I became speechless and I said to myself, 'No wonder this book was a classic.' It was absolutely the most heart-warming story I have ever read!The arrangement of the plot was fantastic and the ending was just perfect. It was easy to understand and since there were some illustrations, it was much fun to read. I really adore the artist who drew the illustrations since it was drawn clearly and artistically.I truly love this book. An all time classic favorite.", rating: 5, book_id: 12, user_id: 54 },
  {title: "Review", review: "The stories in this collection were written by an unassuming yet serious Catholic woman from Georgia who, after devoting her short life to writing, died of lupus in 1964. Besides the stories, she had written two novels and started a third; one can only speculate what other masterpieces she would have written had she lived longer.The stories are hard-bitten, bizarre and haunting. Two that I read years ago in college have stuck with me and are just as jarring today as they were then. O'Connor's theme is the warpedness that resides deep in the human heart. Her protagonists are usually people who think quite highly of themselves. They are often nice people who are nice to everyone (within reasonable limits, of course) and think that the world would be a nicer place to live if only everyone were as nice as they are (“Good Country People”, “Everything that Rises Must Converge”). There are the people who dream nostalgically of a segregated society where inferiors knew their rank, respected their betters and did not try to move outside of their foreordained place in the pecking order (“The Geranium”, “Judgment Day”). Then there are the educated or artistic types who feel confined or bored by the life they lead, can't wait to escape, and sneer at all the inferior mortals around them (“Good Country People”, “The Enduring Chill”). And of course, there are those horrifying individuals who are evil, have surrendered themselves to it, and commit atrocities just because they can (“A Good Man is Hard to Find”, “The Lame Shall Enter First”).O'Connor's wrath and sarcasm are reserved most of all for those people who are so immured in themselves that they are unaware of their own blindness. Often there is a cataclysmic moment of epiphany when they are confronted at last with their own shortcomings. O'Connor lets these people show us their true colours either by enabling us to eavesdrop on their thoughts or by allowing us to listen to their conversations; she is a master of psychology and of dialogue. In her descriptions of the background scenery, nature often serves to highlight the desire of certain characters to escape their circumstances or the feeling of being trapped in an environment from which they cannot disentangle themselves without great effort. These stories are dark, bitter, angry and often tragic. But they are a brilliant barometer of the human heart and the depravity of which it is capable when left untouched by divine grace.", rating: 5, book_id: 18, user_id: 55 },
  {title: "One of the greatest", review: "The Great Gatsby' is one of the greatest works of 1920's literature. It also serves as one of the best windows into the wasteful lives of the diletantes who amassed great wealth in that decade before the bills for unregulated greed became due. Fitzgerald was a young Army officer in World War I who met a teenaged beauty, Zelda Sayre, while training in the South. They were engaged after the war but Zelda called it off because Fitzgerald was not wealthy enough to provide her with the life of leisure she needed. They were finally married after Fitzgerald met his first success as a novelist at age 24. Fitzgerald's ambition to become a recognized author was driven at least in part in an effort to satisfy Zelda's financial needs. Gatsby, also a young officer in training in Kentucky during the War, met a young woman named Daisy who could not marry him at the time because he was not wealthy enough to provide for her needs. He asked her to wait for him until after the War, but she instead married wealthy Tom Buchanan. What made Gatsby great was his ability to set goals that others would find unattainable, and to optimistically drive himself to accomplish them. He determined to make himself wealthy enough to win the love of Daisy Buchanan. We do not read of specifics in the novel, but we know that Gatsby becomes very wealthy after the War. He becomes a kind of mystery man who is the object of endless speculation about his source of wealth. Some people became very wealthy in the booze trade during 1920's prohibition, including Al Capone and other gangsters. Gatsby has a business associate either in the mob or with mob ties, and it is probable Gatsby became wealthy by rum running. His wealth has given him everything except Daisy. Trying to make up for lost time, Gatsby buys a mansion in West Egg. He can see the green light at the end of the Buchanan estate's dock from his home directly across the bay. Luckily, a young Ivy League graduate freshly out of WWI uniform, Nick Carroway, rents a modest house next door to Gatsby. Nick, like Fitzgerald before him, is a midwesterner transplanted to the Big Apple; he happens to be Daisy's cousin. Gatsby, who strikes up an apparent genuine friendship with Nick, nevertheless uses him to make an introduction to his former sweetheart. Daisy and Gatsby start an affair while her husband Tom continues his not-so-secret extramarital relationship with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of George, a down-and-out mechanic. Fitzgerald produces a work which is devoted to exposing the emptiness and hypocrisy in the lives of the beautiful people of the 'Jazz Age.' He makes you wonder why Gatsby was so obsessed with Daisy. She has everything: beauty, money, homes, a jealous-wealthy husband, a beautiful daughter, but she is a pampered, spoiled woman. Her superficial outlook on life includes the lack of outward affection even to her child. Nick, trying to get established in the bond business on Wall Street, becomes disillusioned and moves back home after witnessing his friend's ruin. Myrtle, no doubt hoping against hope for her association with Tom Buchanan to elevate her from the Wilson hovel to a classy life, meets a sudden and tragic end. And then there is Gatsby, who finds that great wealth buys great possessions, but cannot buy his former life with Daisy back. Fitzgerald is not content in leaving Gatsby ultimately holding the empty bag of unrequited love. He arranges for his public humiliation by Tom, who denounces Gatsby as a common bootlegger in front of their friends. In a way, Gatsby is a forerunner of Al Pacino's character, Tony Montana, in the 1983 movie 'Scarface.' Montana clawed his way from common origins by drug dealing, the modern version of bootlegging. Tony believed you needed lots of money to be respectable; money got power; and power got girls. We find that Gatsby likewise got more respectability in society than Tony Montana, possibly because he is a WASP. But he was still tainted as new wealth, as Buchanan reminds all of their friends, and he doesn't get to keep the girl in the end. Finally, Fitzgerald makes Gatsby the victim of his own emotions, placing him in line for his own physical destruction because he cannot reveal a crime committed by the woman who no longer loves him.The book's characters are sharply drawn and the story has enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested to the end. This is a highly enjoyable read.By the way, the edition shown with this review was not the one I read. Nothing against Kathleen Parkinson's study guide, but I read the edition with the original cover art reproduced; however, I couldn't access its through Goodreads when I did this review.", rating: 4, book_id: 20, user_id: 55 },
  {title: "Short book", review: "I found a copy of Achebe’s collected poems at the library quite by chance. It’s a thin book with less than 90 pages. The book was split into five sections: Prologue, Poems About War, Poems Not About War , Gods, Men and Others, and Epilogue. I enjoyed these simple poems that dealt with various topics, including war,love, African life and mythology.In 1966, Achebe says: “Absentminded our thoughtful days sat at dire controls and played indolently.” The section entitled Poems About War discussed the Biafran War. “Christmas in Biafra” was especially poignant: “This sunken-eyed moment wobbling Down the rocky steepness on broken Bones slowly fearfully to hideous Concourse of gathering sorrows in the valley Will yet become in another year a lost Christmas irretrievable in the heights.” I also liked Pine Tree in Spring, which was dedicated to Leon Damas: “Pine tree flag bearer of green memory across the breach of a desolate hour Loyal tree that stood guard alone in austere emeraldry over Nature’s recumbent standard Pine tree lost now in the shade of traitors decked out flamboyantly marching back unabashed to the colors they betrayed Fine tree erect and trustworthy what school can teach me your silent, stubborn fidelity?”All in all, a nice poetry collection that made me wish Achebe had written more.", rating: 4, book_id: 4, user_id: 56 },

  {title: "Awkward", review: "My sister saw The Glass Castle on my coffee table and said, “Oh, I read that.

When I first saw this book, I think I died a little inside because of the cover. I didn’t hate The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood like I hated The Mermaid Chair or (*shudder*) Bastard out of Carolina, but when there’s a little girl on the cover of a book, looking all innocent, it’s like a movie with the word “Education” in the title. You just know you’re in for a published trip to the psychiatrist’s couch. Kiddy-sex and soul-searching. I’m not saying people shouldn’t tell their stories (I mean, look at me, I’m all up in your website telling my stories), but I do think people should get a handle on what their story is before they try to tell it. Or at least before they make me read it. Sorry, that’s kind of asshole-ish of me to say, but I just think a lot of books with innocent little girls on the cover are really arrogant. They have this sense that since some man did something horrifying, everything that women do, including dancing around a fire with girlfriends or taking exotic lovers, is just part of the loving circle of nature’s healing. I am such a fan of women, and so I take it personally when we look like morons. This book has absolutely nothing in common with its cover. I haven’t written a review of it before because I think it is a perfect book, and how do you review a perfect book? I’m like Wayne and Garth when they meet Alice Cooper. This book is my Alice Cooper. I’m sure it wouldn’t be everyone’s Alice Cooper, but to me this is exactly what a book should be. Everything about the book is simple, concise, and action-packed. It makes me laugh and it makes me cry. The people are incredible, but deep and smart and human. In some ways, I think this book is the Great American Story, but it’s the story none of us talk about and all of us live. In other ways, the book is so specific and personal to the Walls family that I never would have imagined the stories if I had not been told them. Virginia Woolf and Rainer Maria Rilke, two of the wisest people I have read, both ask when and how women will be able to tell stories without being self-conscious that they are women. How can we write, or even live, not as reactions to men, but as separate masters of our own experiences? I don’t know where the genders are on the space/time continuum of respecting each other, and I think there are probably gender-related specifics to any story (maybe that’s just natural and not even bad), but there is something about this book that is just human and strong. It is compassionate and unflinching. Oh, I hate adjectives. Just, read the first chapter of this book, and if you don’t think it’s compelling, don’t keep reading because it’s probably not for you. My family was nomadic, like Jeannette Walls’s family, but, like I say, all of her stories, and my stories, are unique. When I last lived with my parents, it struck me that we never really understand other people’s relationships with each other. I grew up, probably as many of us did, thinking that my parents never really got along and that my mom was a victim of my dad’s anger and wild scheming. But, later, I realized they probably both got something that I never understood out of their relationship. I think a lot of this book is about how we know the people we are close to and, also, never really do – how it is useless to hold other people to our own standards of what love or responsibility looks like. But, still, it is about holding each other responsible. Or, maybe the book is just about her family with no real moral lesson at all. Walls is so loyal to her stories in an almost scientific way. None of the adult outrage that contaminates so many stories of children creeps into Walls’s. She tells you what happened, and maybe how she felt about it at the time, but she doesn’t impose emotion on the reader. Here’s just a small part (well, actually, half . . . I couldn’t resist) of the first chapter to give you a little taste:Mom was sitting at a booth, studying the menu, when I arrived. She’d made an effort to fix herself up. She wore a bulky gray sweater with only a few light stains, and black leather men’s shoes. She’d washed her face, but her neck and temples were still dark with grime.She waved enthusiastically when she saw me. “It’s my baby girl!” she called out. I kissed her cheek. Mom had dumped all the plastic packets of soy sauce and duck sauce and hot-and-spicy mustard from the table into her purse. Now she emptied a wooden bowl of dried noodles into it as well. “A little snack for later on,” she explained.We ordered. Mom chose the Seafood Delight. “You know how I love my seafood,” she said.She started talking about Picasso. She’d seen a retrospective of his work and decided he was hugely overrated. All the cubist stuff was gimmicky, as far as she was concerned. He hadn’t really done anything worthwhile after his Rose Period.“I’m worried about you,” I said. “Tell me what I can do to help.”Her smile faded. “What makes you think I need your help?”“I’m not rich,” I said. “But I have some money. Tell me what it is you need.”She thought for a moment. “I could use an electrolysis treatment.”“Be serious.”“I am serious. If a woman looks good, she feels good.”“Come on, Mom.” I felt my shoulders tightening up, the way they invariably did during these conversations. “I’m talking about something that could help you change your life, make it better.”“You want to help me change my life?” Mom asked. “I’m fine. You’re the one who needs help. Your values are all confused.”“Mom, I saw you picking through trash in the East Village a few days ago.”“Well, people in this country are too wasteful. It’s my way of recycling.” She took a bite of her Seafood Delight. “Why didn’t you say hello?”“I was too ashamed, Mom. I hid.”Mom pointed her chopsticks at me. “You see?” she said. “Right there. That’s exactly what I’m saying. You’re way too easily embarrassed. Your father and I are who we are. Accept it.”“And what am I supposed to tell people about my parents?”“Just tell the truth,” Mom said. “That’s simple enough.”It’s been a while since I read this book, so a lot of the stories aren’t fresh in my mind, but some are so vivid to me that I think of them whenever I see a trash can or think of the desert. In high school, I thought that American history was the most boring topic imaginable. Then, in college, I took a class called the History of Women in the U.S., and I realized that I think the history of industry and conquest is mind-numbing, but the history of actual people is riveting. The Glass Castle is a real, honest history (or as honest as histories can be) of people in America. It is so close to me and so foreign in just the way this country is. It is also, in a way, a tribute to family oral histories. My dad has a . . . loose . . . relationship with the truth, as I’ve probably mentioned on this site before. In the past couple of years, every time I see one of my siblings, we sit around and tell stories from my dad or about my dad, trying to weed out what actually happened, what got a nice polish in the story factory, and what is an outright lie. I get that same feeling from this book – of siblings sitting around and saying, “Do you remember . . .” and “You weren’t there this one time . . .” or “No, that’s just what Dad said happened, what actually happened was . . .” I’m sure someday, my siblings and I will put together a history of our own, since every one of us seems to have inherited the storytelling gene. Whatever I write will be in some way inspired by this book.", rating: 5, book_id: 19, user_id: 62 },
  {title: "Snarky, snarky bitch", review: "Let’s face it…. Jonathan Swift was a snarky, snarky bitch. Gulliver’s Travels is like a giant  pimp slap across the human race face and I am so glad I finally read this in a non-school, non-structured environment because I had a whole lot more fun with it this time around. Swift’s wit, insight and delivery are often, though not always, remarkable and he crams more well thought out jabs and toe-steppings in this slim 250 page novel than I would have thought possible in a work twice this long.   This is certainly a classic that I believe people should read and experience for themselves outside of any required scholarly endeavors because I think that many of the ills, injustices and idiocies that Swift addresses in this novel are still, unfortunately, very relevant today. While Swift is short on resolutions or ideas for improvement (one of my disappointments) he does a marvelous job of exposing the problems that he perceived as existing within the 18th Century world, most particularly England, and opening the door for a more expansive, popular discussion on these issues.Kudos for that, Mr Swift.  From a plot perspective, Gulliver’s Travels is a series of adventures by Lemuel Gulliver to various undiscovered, fictional worlds that act as a backdrop for Swift, through his main character/mouthpiece, to scathe, rebuke, poke fun at and/or question all manner of political, religious  and social institutions, philosophies and groups. Everything from blind adherence to political ideologies or religious dogma, to ideological intolerance, to arbitrary social divisions and even the non-practical aspects of the rampant scientific explorations so in vogue at the time. Few groups were spared from Swift's caustic lens and many of his attacks are vehement bordering on brutal. Good. That is how such a work should be IMHO.  Overall, I thought this was very worthwhile and many of Swift’s commentaries were piercing,  brilliant and exceptionally well done. Some of my personal favorites include:  ** Parodying the massive waste of energy and resources expended in political infighting in Great Britain between the Whigs and Tories by having the two Lilliputian political parties separated solely by the aesthetic choice between wearing high heels and low heels. I can only imagine how this parody played out among the MP of England at the time.  ** Making light of the tremendous importance placed on seemingly trivial differences in religious doctrine that often lead to the most acrimonious wars and civil strife by explaining that the genesis of a long and bloody war between rival factions of Lilliputians stems from a disagreement over where to crack eggs. One group break their eggs on the small end (Small Endians) and the other break their eggs on the large end (Big Endians). What I found most clever about this attack was the use of an ambiguous reference in each side's “holy book” that states, “all true believers break their eggs at the convenient end.” That is just about perfect satire Mr. Swift. ** A biting jab at traditions and customs that people cling to long after there is no practical reason to do so is eloquently made when Gulliver describes the Lilliputians custom of burying their dead head first.    They bury their dead with their heads directly downwards, because they hold an opinion that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise again, in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will turn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection, be found ready standing on their feet. The learned among them confess the absurdity of this doctrine, but the practice still continues, in compliance to the vulgar. When Swift is on his game, he is very, very effective.** A wonderful anti-war statement is made through the horror and disgust with which the King of the giant Brobdingnagians (their size depicted as representing moral superiority) reacts to Gulliver’s description of gunpowder and his offer to teach the Brobdingnagians the formula for producing it: I told him of ‘an invention, discovered between three and four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder…[t]hat a proper quantity of this powder…would drive a ball of iron or lead, with such violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its force. That the largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when linked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them. That we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and discharged them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which would rip up the pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw splinters on every side, dashing out the brains of all who came near…...The king was struck with horror at the description I had given of those terrible engines, and the proposal I had made. ‘He was amazed, how so impotent and groveling an insect as I…could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner, as to appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which I had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines; whereof,’ he said, ‘some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been the first contriver.’ As for himself, he protested, that although few things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet he would rather lose half his kingdom, than be privy to such a secret; which he commanded me, as I valued any life, never to mention any more. Sorry for the long quote, but I thought that was a particularly moving passage. ** My personal favorite (purely from an enjoyment standpoint) is the depiction of the scientifically adept and common-senseless Laputans  who exemplify Swift’s serious gripe against scientific research that doesn’t have a practical and foreseeable benefit to society. The first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face…[H]e has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers. He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight years more, he should be able to supply the governor’s gardens with sunshine, at a reasonable rate…. Gulliver’s exploration of the scientific academy of Laputa was my favorite part of the novel and I thought Swift’s satiric chops were at there sharpest in relaying the societal dysfunction of the Laputans.  Now I must drop some ice in the bath water. As much as there was to enjoy in this work, I was not as blown away by it as I would have liked to have been. For one thing, I thought that Swift’s prose was merely serviceable and I didn’t find much in the way of eloquence in his delivery. It was missing the ear-pleasing lyrical quality that I have come to expect when reading classic literature. The writing wasn’t bad by any means but it wasn’t as enjoyable or memorable as I had hoped. This may be an unfair critique given that this book’s legacy lies with its content, but the lack of beautiful prose kept me from being able to enjoy the interludes and non-meaty passages of the work.    Also, some of Swift’s critiques fell a bit flat and didn't resonate with me as much as those mentioned above. For instance, the recasting of famous historical figures like Alexander, Hannibal and Caesar as being more subject to the moral frailties of the human animal than the established texts would have us believe. Swift uses this as the springboard to discuss the less than wholesome practices of securing political power today and that is a good thing. I just found the use of the legends of antiquity unnecessary and not particularly effective. That’s probably a personal bias of mine as I have always found those figures fascinating to read about.    Here's my biggest problem. One of the principal arguments that Swift makes in his novel is that balance and moderation are the keys to success both individually and as a people. Extremes of behavior and belief are the seeds from which disastrous consequences are born, according to Swift. That’s easy to say and it has an attractive ring to it, but I wish Swift had done a little more with it. This walkmy right into my biggest complaint about the story…the ending. I thought that the ambiguity of Gulliver’s condition at the end of the novel was a bit of a cop out. It appears as though the reader is left to determine whether Gulliver was (1) a man disgusted with humanity as a result of his exposure to the morally righteous and logically rational Houyhnhnm or (2) a man whose ill-conceived and intemperate worship of, and infatuation with the Houyhnhnm made him just another unbalanced yahoo whose loss of perspective and left him deranged.   Part of the answer of this would stem from determining whether Swift was holding up the Houyhnhnms as a model to follow or whether their own passionless adherence to logic was itself a subject of parody. However, as with the end, I think Swift was less than certain of his position (or of the position he wanted to state) and thus left too much ambiguity to the reader. Now I understand that often these kinds of soft endings are perfect as they allow the reader to interpret the work for themselves. However, here where Swift has been bludgeoning the reader with his opinions throughout the entire work, to suddenly punt and not clearly express a case for his protagonist seems to be a miss. That said, I am the first to acknowledge that it is anywhere from a distinct possibility to a metaphysical certainty that the “miss” here is on my part, but that was how I saw it.

  {title: "Love this book!", review: "I looooooooved this book. Another Dickens...another favorite. 'Please, sir, I want some more.' Jane Austen and Charles Dickens have been dueling inside my WOW center for some time in a titanic, see-saw struggle for the title of greatest word-smither/story-crafter in all of English literature. Ms Austen previously caused heart-palpitations and a slew of gasms with Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility which left me spent like a cheap nickel. However, Sir Dickens, being a slick, wily devil responded in kind with A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations, a pair of wonderfully addictive, tingle causing joy blasts full of jaw-drops and breezy elegance. Where this battle of master word charmers will end….I could really care less because I’m sporting a complete happy going through their respective catalogs with a perma-smile on my face. Next up on the parade of mouth-watering, phrase turning feasts is The Adventures of Oliver Twist which is terrific on several levels. In relating the tragic (but ultimately rewarding) life of Oliver Twist, Dickens is at his most Austenesque as he employs with great effect biting sarcasm and dry, dark humor to scathingly satire the English Poor Laws of the 1830s. Of the novels I’ve read by Dickens, this is him at his most “socially conscious” and he strategically uses Oliver’s biography to harshly spotlight the greed, hypocrisy and let’s just say it…evil…of the society that organized and profited by the work house system of the middle 19th century.   So they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they,) of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it. We follow Oliver beginning with his difficult birth that killed his mother and almost cost the young lad his life as well. There was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration- a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence… From there we journey with the child as he is dumped into a workhouse where his early life goes from bad to horrendously shitty as he’s subjected to a systematic process of neglect, physical brutality and starvation along with the other children residing there. Here is a passage from Chapter 2 that I think perfectly encapsulates the subtly sarcastic style Dickens employs to address his subject matter. The parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be ‘farmed,’ or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food, or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny’s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher. Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rapacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four and twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosopher of the female to whose care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of her system; for at the very moment when a child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this. I love the way Dickens can describe callous starvation and casual murder of children for nothing more than greed in such a way that I was actually chuckling because of his lusciously humorous phrasing. This man could write.Eventually, Oliver’s life takes another turn from horrendously shitty to mega-painful-chunks-of-misery-filled-crap when he has the temerity to utter the famous words,  “Please, sir, I want some more.' He gets more…more beatings, more starvation,more verbal abuse,more neglect,…and ultimately finds himself alone on the streets with no means of survival. There, Oliver finds himself sucked into a life of petty criminality under the tutelage of “Fagin the Jew” who I thought was one of the most compelling Dickens characters ever.**[**Note: I know there is a lot of controversy about the portrayal of Fagin being one of the most egregious cases of anti-Semitism in classic literature. I think the criticism is fair, but I also don’t think (based on what I’ve read) that Dickens’ had any malicious intent. It is what it is and everyone can make their own decision on that point.] I thought the character of Fagin was fascinating and his signature phrase my dear (which he uses in almost every sentence) is still popping into my head more than a week after finishing the novel. Fagin, while irredeemably evil and in some ways a criminal caricature, Dickens draws him with such flair imbues him with a dimension and essence that I found very compelling. His psychology, his calculating intelligence and his soft words masking despicable actions is deftly laid out. At times, I almost got the impression that Fagin was intended to represent “the devil himself” with the way Dickens focuses on his corrupting influence. In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils; and, having prepared his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it and change its hue for ever. On one level, the life of Oliver Twist is one of the harshest, most depressingly sad tales ever put to paper. In lesser hands, the heartache and forlornness of Oliver’s birth and tragic early life could have swallowed up the story and made the book a real chore to get through. Good news…these are not lesser hands.Dickens writing is so melodic that the narrative glides over the horror at a safe middle-distance, allowing us to observe and absorb the surroundings without drowning in the pain that Dickens describes. I thought it was masterful. Intimate yet detached. Eventually, the plot takes a mysterious turn as a shadowy figure arrives on the scene who has a connection to Oliver and his past that is slowly revealed over the last half of the story. All of this leads to a marvelous ending that makes the rest of the story far more enjoyable in retrospect…sometimes positive, warm and fuzzy resolutions are exactly what a story needs. Dickens prose is buttery smooth while his mocking humor is cheddar sharp. His balance is outstanding and his ability to poke fun at his readers’ society while avoiding making the reader themselves feel like a target is brilliant. I had such a wonderful time reading this that I am left wondering why everyone doesn’t love Dickens as much as I do. 5.0 stars.

  {title: "Move aside, Sherlock ", review: "Move aside, Sherlock…Sir Arthur has conjured a protagonist who's an even more arrogant assbag than you. Everyone...the intrepid, the indefatigable, the insufferable Professor G.E. Challenger… If, like me, you enjoy characters that are gruff, prideful curmudgeonly sorts, than you will have fun with this guy. He is a serious hoot. Trust me.  Physically, Prof. Challenger is a funhouse mirror reflection of Mr. Holmes. Instead of a tall, lanky, clean-shaven gentlemen who calmly condescends to the world around him, we have a short, barrel-chested, physically imposing caveman, with a booming voice and serious anger management issues.   Tell me he doesn't look like the spitting image of Bluto...from Popeye. Hmmm?Intellectually, however, Challenger is definitely a pea from the same pompous pod as Doyle's most famous literary creation. Zero charm, no social graces and a chip on his shoulder the size of Gibraltar. He is a serious piece of unrestrained windbaggery that pins the needle on the Arrogasshat Pricktardo Scale. And he doled out some serious happy to me while I reading. Like Holmes, of whom I am a screaming fanboy, I found G.E. Challenger to be enormously fun to listen to as he waxed vaingloriously about his greatness and scientific acumen. While I wouldn't want to spend any real-life time socializing with the ill-mannered prig, as a literary companion he's an absolute blast. I can think of no better way to introduce you to the professor, and his over-the-top disagreeability, than the method employed by Doyle to unveil him to readers of The Lost World. When reporter Edward Malone (hiding his true vocation) requests a meeting with the reclusive scientist, this is the letter he receives in reply. SIR, I have duly received your note, in which you claim to endorse my views, although I am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement either from you or anyone else. You have ventured to use the word “speculation” with regard to my statement upon the subject of Darwinism, and I would call your attention to the fact that such a word in such a connection is offensive to a degree. The context convinces me, however, that you have sinned rather through ignorance and tactlessness than through malice, so I am content to pass the matter by. You quote an isolated sentence from my lecture, and appear to have some difficulty in understanding it. I should have thought that only a sub-human intelligence could have failed to grasp the point, but if it really needs amplification I shall consent to see you at the hour named, though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding distasteful to me. As to your suggestion that I may modify my opinion, I would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a deliberate expression of my mature views. You will kindly show the envelope of this letter to my man, Austin, when you call, as he has to take every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call themselves “journalists.” Yours faithfully,     GEORGE EDWARD CHALLENGER. Yes...he's like that. Plus he's violent, quick-tempered, pig-headed, racist, elitist, and is not above putting his wife in 'time out' when he feels she has misbehaved. Yeah, he's pretty much the whole package of awesome. Once I read that, I knew I was in for something loaded with win.  PLOT SUMMARY: Not sure this is really necessary, so I will keep this brief. As the title suggests, this is one of the archetypes of the “lost world” genre and Sir Arthur brings his usual skill to its execution. A journalist (the aforementioned Edward Malone) eager to impress his girlfriend, requests a dangerous assignment. He lands a doozy when an expedition is planned to prove (or disprove) Challenger's claim of having discovered an isolated region of the Amazon inhabited by dinosaurs, pterodactyls and other extinct and exotic creatures. Together with Challenger, another professor (the obligatory skeptic), and Lord Roxton, the standard rough and ready adventurer, the four embark on their fateful quest.Frills, thrills, spills, chills and kills ensue...in abundance.THOUGHTS: This is by the numbers storytelling for this sub genre, but Doyle’s talent and engaging prose make it a lot of fun. It's a given that the fantastic elements of the story have, to an extent, lost their ability to deliver the WOW that they originally produced, and the book's sense of depicting the truly wondrous does suffer a bit as a result. Still, I was pleasantly surprised at how engaging the narrative was and how much fun I had listening to Challenger and his colleagues expound with fervor on their dated scientific theories. Excellent storytelling has no expiration date, and Doyle, like contemporaries H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, has the ability to engage and captivate his audience with the wonders of a bygone age.  I enjoyed myself, Sir Arthur. Thank you. 3.5 stars.

  {title: "First time read", review: "Although I have read several of his novels, this is the first time I have read Thomas Hardy's poetry and, as it does in all of its collections, Dover has gathered a selection from throughout his writing career. What struck me throughout my reading was the almost ever-present sadness. There were some poems that escaped into blissful enjoyment of nature or love, but it seemed that the majority were caught up in loss of life or love or health. As I said in one of my updates, and reaffirm on finishing reading, there is much sadness in the poems --both personal and related to war time loss. Also, some very poignant writing. I am looking forward to reading his biography as I wonder how many of the very personal-appearing poems may be autobiographical (if any).While there is much sorrow in Hardy's poetry, there is also beauty, the joy of nature, the intensity of tangled emotions and relationships. This is a very nice introduction. Dover does its usual consistent good work here. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone wishing to dip into the poetic works of Hardy.

  {title: "Slow starter", review: "The first of the poems in Thom Gunn’s Collected to really knock me out appears half way through his second book, The Sense of Movement (1957). In the poem, “To Yvor Winters, 1955,” Gunn pays homage to his former teacher with a portrait of the Stanford professor that compares his training of Airedale terriers—an activity that requires “boxer’s vigilance and poet’s rigour”—to his life as a scholar who must…keep both Rule and Energy in view,Much power in each, most in the balanced two:Ferocity existing in the fenceBuilt by an exercised intelligence.The poem is Augustan in its form, Latinate in its diction, and philosophic in its argument, yet it feels warm and humane throughout. In this respect, the poem reminds me of Auden’s “In Memory of Sigmund Freud”—another homage to a public intellectual. Like Auden’s, Gunn’s poem is elegiac. Though Winters would not die for another thirteen years, Gunn is already aware that “night is always close, complete negation/ Ready to drop on wisdom and emotion.” The poem knows that the mind is as mortal as the body and so turns for its consolation to teaching: the dissatisfied urge to “raise from the excellent the better still.”It is all the more moving to me then that some of the last great poems of the collection are elegies to Charlie Hinkle, one of Gunn’s graduate students, who died of AIDS in the late 1980’s. Written in the same iambic pentameter couplets in which he wrote “To Yvor Winters, 1955”—and so many of his other long meditations—“The J Car” also mourns the loss of a great mind, one that must suffer the knowledge that “he would not write the much-conceived/ Much-hoped-for work now.” But the bulk of the poem’s attention is on the body, on the life of sensations that dissipates slowly with the body’s diminishment. Gunn describes meals he shared with his friend in the last year of his life, meals during which “the connection between life and food/ Had briefly seemed so obvious if so crude.” He notes the painful contrast between his friend’s sickness and his own health, including such details as “I’d eat his dessert” as if shy of presenting his visits in a saintly light, yet he doesn’t let the narrative tip into self-indulgent assertions of guilt either. In a similar display of tact, he steers away from the emotional traps inherent in elegy, mourning his friend without idealizing him, achieving a tone to match his friend’s taste for food like Sauerbraten “In which a sourness and dark richness meet.”[click on the first comment on this review for the last paragraph]", rating: 5, book_id: 4, user_id: 66 },

Lee and his journals written when he was part of the Army of the Potomac and Gettysburg have been cited by noted historians of his age and ages past.  The second of his twelve volume observation of the Art of War discussed Hannibal and, this is that volume.         Dodge is a slave to minutia and detail.  He tends to run through the supply train then go back over the roles of each different unit and major player, regardless of how much the overlapped.  It is easy to get caught up in the attention to detail here, and I nearly did.  Then, strangely, Hannibal began to take shape as a person, a very remarkable person.  A boy wizard general like Alexander before him, once given the go-ahead to harass and invade the Roman Empire crossed the Alps and did not return again until many years later.  He fought the Romans and their Allies, the Lombards, Gauls and other Germanic tribesmen with his own, very diverse multi-national force from North Africa.        Despite his obsession with minute details, Dodge manages sort through differing reports from the two leading Roman Historians who wrote about Hannibal settling disputed evidence with a very practical warrior’s sense of what’s likely, and unleashed the Romantic Noble Warrior in his heart.  One might argue that he blended a romanticized version of Robert E. Lee into his vision of Hannibal and not be far from the truth.  One might say that he made up a lot of facts because there is scarce evidence to support any version of Hannibal’s conquests.  Well you could say that, but it’s not exactly true.  And of course, all of those arguments, while even possibly valid, will miss the true value of a book like this.       The beauty of Dodge’s work is that it gives those people who write fiction stories, be they fantasy, Science Fiction or historical fiction, a frame that they can use to help imagine a great hero in an impossible situation defying the odds, not for a month or a year, but for more than a decade.   Hannibal was the Resistance fighting the Empire in Star Wars.  He was “Black Jack Geary” from Jack Campbell’s wonderful “Lost Fleet Series” hopelessly lost behind enemy lines, with no hope of relief battling his way back to safe space.   He’s Adamma from Battlestar Galactica 2005, the television series starring Edward James Olmos leading his rag-tag fugitive fleet, seeking a safe haven from the hoards of Cylons chasing them.  He’s “Hile Troy” from Stephen R. Donaldson’s “Wounded land” series battling the forces of the Despiser (and one of the few heroes we could like from that series).  In Dodge’s Hannibal I can see Robert E. Lee, faced with a choice between duty and the land that he was born and raised in fighting the overpowering union army as much as Sherman disappearing in South Carolina only to reappear in Vicksburg with Ulysses Grant.  I can even see Thorgrim the king leading his riders to rescue Minas Tirith at least for one battle’s worth looking like Hannibal, invincible against all Sauron’s might.   And here, is one hero, cut much like those I’ve loved in books, except this one is real taking on the enormous might of the Roman Empire.  The best strategy the Roman’s ever came up with was, “if it’s Hannibal, do not engage, don’t’ fight and we can’t get beat,” at least until Scipio Africanus figured out that, with Hannibal in Italy, then there was nobody guarding Carthage.  Her is our charismatic leader who holds the alliance together like Captain Ready in the Destroyermen series by Taylor Anderson.  Hannibal.  Who else is there?   So, one can read this and yawn at the numbers and details of the soldiers.  If you don’t like to read about military maneuvers in battles or how Hannibal’s Phalanx would have fared against a properly organized and trained Greek Phalanx, then remember.  There is so much more in this book.  So much to draw from as inspiration if you’re a writer who dares to write a hero through impossible odds and needs a realistic example of how it all comes together.   And the best tidbit of information, the one thing that I didn’t already know about Hannibal is that he lived as a mercenary general fighting with Judea and other nations in the middle east long after his foray into Italy and died an old man after a long and fruitful life.   It’s worth reading at least once.", rating: 5, book_id: 7, user_id: 67 },
  {title: "Good", review: "Mr. McMurtry loves to travel, apparently, doing so serves as an aide in helping him focus on his writing, his work and his life. As his mother was in the final stages of life, he decided to travel “on the old road, the first road, the original superhighway: the sea.” (p. 55) to reflect upon his parents’ relationship. Finding a measure of distance from an event or a problem is often helpful in getting clarity or finding a solution to the subject at hand. I hope he was able to find such on this trip, as the majority of what he discussed was the islands of the South Pacific, particularly the Marquesas. The discussion of his parents’ life together was painful to read. Married for 42+ years but never seemed to enjoy the time they had together. Constant bickering and arguments grew from the frustration they found in the disappointment of the life they had rather than the life for which they had hoped, one where support and words of affirmation and love were a standard of practice. They remained wed, for appearance sake, until the elder Mr. McMurtry died. They chose suffering the misery of an unhappy marriage rather than be seen as “a failure” in the eyes of their neighbors. Mr. McMurtry, being the fine author he is, has used the conflict he witnessed between his parents in creating many of the relationships often found in his novels (Terms of Endearment, Horseman, Pass By, the Duane Moore Series) and speaks dispassionately and with directness of the struggles he witnessed without discounting the love he and his siblings felt from both parents. One would hope he has dealt sufficiently with the pain of his parents discord that the detachment he shows in relating this memoir is the result of resolution and not an act of avoidance.The majority of the book is filled with an abbreviated account of his two week cruse on the supply ship, Aranui, as she sailed around the islands near Tahiti. The ship is “a floating warehouse with a spic-and-span 1970’s-era Holiday Inn on top.” (p. 57). The itinerary was to visit each of the six islands in the nearby chain as the crew would bring “cases of Coca-Cola” and other “necessities” to the local population and pick up the goods produced, usually copra (dried coconut meat) on the islands. At each port, the tourists would go ashore to satisfy “their retail addiction,” buying what was offered, regardless of the quality of said item(s). Mr. McMurtry used the time to study the light as it changed on the sea and played on the mountains. His reflection upon, and the title of the book, paradise is a source of existential contemplation. Each island is a tropical “paradise” but even paradise becomes monotonous, the writer notes, when it is given too easily or witnessed without effort. By the memoirs’ end, the two stories (his parents’ relationship and his tour of “paradise”) have blended into a single narrative. The “paradise” Hazel Ruth and William Jefferson McMurtry expected to find when they married turned out to be dust and worry, the monotony of their dissatisfaction only eased by the joy they found in being parents of their four children. The paradise of the South Pacific islands, once pristine in their innocence and self-sufficiency, was “lost” when the first European explorers made the natives aware of what they didn’t have (but did not need). The world weary passengers who sailed with the author on this voyage wanted to find simple bliss on the islands but were not willing to do without the luxuries they commonly found at home. The McMurtry’s wanted to find delight in marriage but were not willing to give up their selfish expectations in hope of finding more than they dreamt possible. Perhaps I walk in paradise daily and its familiarity has blinded me to the astonishment it holds.", rating: 4, book_id: 14, user_id: 68 },
  {title: "Not just science fiction", review: "It is a pity that people are told this is a science fiction book before they read it. I feel the least interesting thing about it is that it is science fiction. I mean this in much the same way that the least interesting thing one could say about 1984 is that it is science fiction. As a piece of literature I enjoyed it much more than Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake and even more than Huxley's Brave New World. The themes that make this book most interesting are to do with the social alienation of groups of people on the basis of inherited genetic characteristics. In fact, as a critique of racism this book is utterly brilliant. Those being racially alienated are genetically identical (they are in fact clones) to those attacking them.Plato believed those 'in the know' should tell lies to those 'who do not know' so as to protect them from the all too horrible truths about life. I have always hated this aspect of Plato, always finding it grotesque and frightening in its implications. Those implications are drawn out in all their disturbing horror here. This book has much to say about the nature of 'illness' and how those inflicted with an 'illness' use the scars of that illness as the badges of truly belonging to the group. So that those 'less advanced' in the ravages of the illness don't really know or really belong to the group. As a portrait of victims adopting to being victims it says much about us as humans - thoughtful readers may find it says far too much. I write this on World Aids Day.Ishiguro writes the most nightmarish novels I've ever read. In others, such as The Unconsoled or  When We Were Orphans the nightmare feeling is due to the dreamlike oddity of the interconnection of events in the story. One reads these books in much the same way that one wakes from a disturbing dream, with feelings of disorientation and anxiety. Even though this is the most literal 'nightmare book' of his I have read - the world he creates being literally a nightmare, and made all the worse by being set in the recent past - it is a book totally lacking in that strange dreamlike quality so characteristic of these other novels. In this sense it seemed less of a nightmare than these others. If you struggled with these, you will not struggle with this in quite the same way.He also has fascinating and quite painful things to say about the nature of love and how love has a proper time, a time that may be lost or missed. As someone who has loved, lost and missed I found this particularly challenging. The relationship between sex and love and illness is perhaps something people may find simply too much - not because this is handled in any way that is too explicit, but because I do believe we like to think that sex, as a manifestation of love, has curative and redemptive powers. A book that questions this, questions something we hold very dear and some readers may find this too much to ask.This is also a book about betrayal. The betrayals we commit against those we love the most and yet that we barely can understand or explain after we have committed them - these are constant throughout the book. He is a writer all too aware of the human condition. The scene which gives the book its title is a wonderful example of the near impossibility of our being understood by others and yet our endless desire for just such an understanding.There is nothing easy about reading this book - although it is written in the simplest of prose. It has an honesty of feeling that brands one's soul.I loved this book and have thought about it a lot since I finished reading it and will think about it more. There is much more I would like to say, but there is no space. May we all be good carers before we complete.", rating: 5, book_id: 11, user_id: 69 },
  {title: "166 poems", review: "Chekov was an astoundingly prolific author, “publishing as many as one hundred and sixty-six stories between 1886 and 1887 while practicing medicine.” He’d been writing for magazines, newspapers, and periodicals since 1979 when he entered medical school, hoping to supplement his family’s meager income. ”On a visit to St. Petersburg [in 1885], Chekov had been embarrassed by the acclaim that greeted him, because he recognized that much of his output had been hasty and unrevised. ‘If I’d know that that was how they were reading me,’ he wrote his brother Aleksandr, on January 4, 1886, ‘I would not have written like a hack.’”If Chekhov became more considered in his writing, his production never flagged. Senelick’s glorious contribution to scholarship on Chekhov includes some works never before translated, but also gives us a thorough understanding of the evolution of Chekhov as a dramatist.The “Untitled Play” included first in this volume is one Chekhov wrote while still in high school. It suffered innumerable rewritings, unsuccessful submissions, tearing up (!) by the author, but survived because Anton’s younger brother Mikhail had made two copies: one was kept in a safety-deposit box. It is remarkable for its length: there are only four acts, but the first act has twenty-two scenes, runs for fifty pages, and hosts twenty characters, not including the servants. “It’s interest,” Senelick tells us, “lies primarily in its being a storehouse of Chekov’s later themes and characters: the cynical doctor, the cynosure attractive woman, the parasitic buffoons, the practical housewife, and the failed idealist.” The themes are reworked again and again: “most intricately reworked of all, the threat of losing the estate to debts was to become the connecting thread and constitutive symbol of “The Cherry Orchard.””But pieces of that first play has provided material for playwrights and directors including “A Country Scandal,” “A Provincial Don Juan,” “Ce Fou Platonov,” “Fireworks on the James,” “Wild Honey” (Michael Frayn version), “ Player Piano” (Trevor Griffith’s version), and “Platonov” (David Hare’s version), among others. It makes one laugh, the riches to be mined in a failed play by a man, boy really, who had never before written a play meant to be performed on a stage.Senelick includes in this collection “all the plays performed during [Chekhov’s] lifetime and posthumous works, performed or not.” He includes variants to the plays, some edited for the censor, some because the play didn’t need the extra words. But with the variants we can see the process of creation and distillation. Senelick did his own annotations and translations, and gives reasons for his word or phrasing choices. The plays I have seen performed do not use his words, but I think the sense comes through in any case. A play must have a little flexibility, though I think Senelick is right when he says that in some cases exact words must be used as written, since sometimes a word or a phrase is repeated like a chorus, meant to develop the meaning of a play over time for the audience.What a rich experience it must be for students at Tuft’s Fletcher School to have someone direct their plays who knows so much about how a play has come to be, how it has been performed, and how it has been modified. It can't be often that a director has such a deep background in scholarship.Anyway, included in this volume are short monologues, including one that is my very favorite, entitled “The Evils of Tobacco.” Senelick gives two versions of the monologue, each placed roughly chronologically when they were published. One is very early in Chekov’s “stage” career, and another version, continually revised over the years, is placed at the end, right before “The Cherry Orchard.” Successful professional comedians perform endless versions of the same monologue until they have it pared to its funniest and most striking essentials, and it seems Chekhov did the same here. The piece is a miracle of parody: a distinguished educator is asked to give a lecture on a popular topic for a charity benefit. Shortly after his introduction, the lecturer merely mentions the word tobacco and is sent off onto a tangent of several minutes. He brings himself back with an exceedingly brief, boring, and overly scientific couple sentences about tobacco and veers off topic again, ranging into the territory of his health, his preferred food choices, and how his marriage is going. It is short, and it is masterful--the result of a long career thinking about, writing, and staging humorous pieces. Do not miss this.The biography of Chekhov at the beginning of this volume is notable for its depth of knowledge and understanding of Chekhov’s oeuvre. It is short and assured, and gives information that is indispensable for a greater understanding of how, what, and why Chekhov wrote.", rating: 5, book_id: 17, user_id: 70 },
  {title: "Review", review: "The cover of the edition of 'White Teeth' I read (which was unavailable on goodreads) is an illustration of a girl dolefully looking at a herd of cows approaching her, she could also be longing for a herd of cows to be brought to her, so immediately I know the book is about dowry since I judged by its cover which was begging me to judge it anyway. I was half right. The story is about dowry inflation, but it is largely about poverty. A series of unfortunate events take place to an unsuspecting, unprepared and undeserving poor man who leaves his home village to look for money in the city to pay dowry for a wife.'Do not go there and listen to other people's bad advice. It is poverty taking you away from your home, mother and sister. You are poor, your mother is poor, your sister is poor and you come from a poor home. Do not go to Bananaland and start behaving like some rich man's brother.' p.31 'This was the undoing by poverty, for it was poverty that had driven me away from home. This was the undoing by Acholi marriage. It was the undoing by the white man; he brought money to us: it was the undoing by the money: it was too sweet...' p.69I could not bear it.In this village and country, as most African countries before the 90s, (although I feel not much has changed, at least where I'm from), women are bought and owned and considered sources of wealth, widows are inherited by relatives and unmarried women who are past a certain age are prostitutes.'Ladwong, get up immediately! You are a mere wife! I bought you with my own money.' p.48 'Ladwong! Do you think it was your parents who gave me money to marry you with? Listen, the money for marrying you came from our home. Sweep and tidy up the room, and arrange the seats! I don't want laziness and clumsiness in this house. Did your mother not bring you up properly?' p.50 'You have no right to speak in my house. Women have no voice in the family or in clan matters, because they are brought home by money or are married outside the clan.' p.53 'I bought the items for my little sister because she was my future wealth. Therefore, money spent on her was invested. I wanted to make her attractive and desirable to young men. Her bridewealth could fetch me a wife in future.' p.83The narrator likens this investment to an investment in crop and cattle,'Wealth must be looked after: even crops in the field must be weeded if they were to yield much; goats, sheep, chickens and cattle must be husbanded before they could increase in number. if animals are not tended well, they get ruined and perish altogether. That was why I was buying all these good things for Aciro: to make her beautiful and attractive to young men..' p.83Well.But where else was a man of no education and no inherited wealth from his dead father to get wealth with which to buy himself a wife. The man with many beautiful daughters was the wealthiest man in the village.Of course the poor man gets chewed up and spat out by the city with very little to show for his 4 years there.The poor get poorer.", rating: 3, book_id: 26, user_id: 71 },
  {title: "Thrilling crime fiction", review: "Note: Wattpad story. “My Sister's Keeper” is a thrilling crime fiction, about brother and sister who get involved in solving a mystery. I enjoyed reading it. The story includes family problem of Richrad that also has mystery in it. Characters- They were mysterious. I liked bond between Richard and Martha, a perfect siblings. Antagonist was smart psycho who was always 2 step ahead of this sibling. Martha was a real hero of the story and I loved her. Police detective, well I haven’t heard of such dumb one in any novel, really! He was the biggest disappointing person in this book. Things I liked- Easy to read and understand plot, fast-paced, every chapter was a cliffhanger that made me read it till the end. Lot of twist and turns. Emotions and feelings of characters was heartfelt. Richrad and Martha truly drawn me in their world. I was smiling, crying, angry and anxious along with them. There was a story behind all characters which helped to know them more clearly.Drawback- I felt it was too stretched at some point. Even expected at some points. It gave me a feeling that I just want to rich to the climax. So many things went wrong at once in Richard’s life that were impossible in real life. Main characters did some stupidest things, but hey, doesn’t that happen in every mystery! So, I won’t say it a drawback exactly.This story is all about family and life.Alert! There are few very disturbing plots and twists so harden your heart before reading it.Overall, I like it. You just want to enjoy a story without judging anything then you'll enjoy it just like watching a TV show/drama.", rating: 4, book_id: 10, user_id: 72 }
